aliases: [bazelisk]
name: bazel
flags:
  --server_jvm_out=: <path>The location to write the server's JVM's output. If unset
    then defaults to a location in output_base.
  --nowindows_enable_symlinks: If true, real symbolic links will be created on Windows
    instead of file copying. Requires Windows developer mode to be enabled and Windows
    10 version 1703 or greater.
  --block_for_lock: When --noblock_for_lock is passed, Bazel does not wait for a running
    command to complete, but instead exits immediately.
  --windows_enable_symlinks: If true, real symbolic links will be created on Windows
    instead of file copying. Requires Windows developer mode to be enabled and Windows
    10 version 1703 or greater.
  --local_startup_timeout_secs=: The maximum amount of time the client waits to connect
    to the server
  --nowrite_command_log: 'WARNING: This option is deprecated and will be removed soon.
    Please use the command option instead.'
  --noquiet: If true, no informational messages are emitted on the console, only errors.
    Changing this option will not cause the server to restart.
  --install_md5=: This launcher option is intended for use only by tests.
  --default_system_javabase=: The root of the user's local JDK install, to be used
    as the default target javabase and as a fall-back host_javabase. This is not the
    embedded JDK.
  --nopreemptible: If true, the command can be preempted if another command is started.
  --preemptible: If true, the command can be preempted if another command is started.
  --ignore_all_rc_files: Disables all rc files, regardless of the values of other
    rc-modifying flags, even if these flags come later in the list of startup options.
  --noworkspace_rc: Whether or not to look for the workspace bazelrc file at `$workspace/.bazelrc`
  --nounlimit_coredumps: Raises the soft coredump limit to the hard limit to make
    coredumps of the server (including the JVM) and the client possible under common
    conditions. Stick this flag in your bazelrc once and forget about it so that you
    get coredumps when you actually encounter a condition that triggers them.
  --server_javabase=: <jvm path>Path to the JVM used to execute Bazel itself.
  --connect_timeout_secs=: The amount of time the client waits for each attempt to
    connect to the server
  --lock_install_base: Whether the server should hold a lock on the install base while
    running, to prevent another server from attempting to garbage collect it.
  --autodetect_server_javabase: When --noautodetect_server_javabase is passed, Bazel
    does not fall back to the local JDK for running the bazel server and instead exits.
  --workspace_rc: Whether or not to look for the workspace bazelrc file at `$workspace/.bazelrc`
  --failure_detail_out=: <path>If set, specifies a location to write a failure_detail
    protobuf message if the server experiences a failure and cannot report it via
    gRPC, as normal. Otherwise, the location will be ${OUTPUT_BASE}/failure_detail.rawproto.
  --quiet: If true, no informational messages are emitted on the console, only errors.
    Changing this option will not cause the server to restart.
  --macos_qos_class=: 'Sets the QoS service class of the %{product} server when running
    on macOS. This flag has no effect on all other platforms but is supported to ensure
    rc files can be shared among them without changes. Possible values are: user-interactive,
    user-initiated, default, utility, and background.'
  --noidle_server_tasks: Run System.gc() when the server is idle
  --install_base=: This launcher option is intended for use only by tests.
  --nosystem_rc: Whether or not to look for the system-wide bazelrc.
  --command_port=: Port to start up the gRPC command server on. If 0, let the kernel
    choose.
  --noignore_all_rc_files: Disables all rc files, regardless of the values of other
    rc-modifying flags, even if these flags come later in the list of startup options.
  --noshutdown_on_low_sys_mem: If max_idle_secs is set and the build server has been
    idle for a while, shut down the server when the system is low on free RAM. Linux
    and MacOS only.
  --idle_server_tasks: Run System.gc() when the server is idle
  --noclient_debug: If true, log debug information from the client to stderr. Changing
    this option will not cause the server to restart.
  --fatal_event_bus_exceptions: Whether or not to exit if an exception is thrown by
    an internal EventBus handler. No-op if --fatal_async_exceptions_exclusions is
    available; that flag's behavior is preferentially used.
  --noautodetect_server_javabase: When --noautodetect_server_javabase is passed, Bazel
    does not fall back to the local JDK for running the bazel server and instead exits.
  --batch_cpu_scheduling: Only on Linux; use 'batch' CPU scheduling for Blaze. This
    policy is useful for workloads that are non-interactive, but do not want to lower
    their nice value. See 'man 2 sched_setscheduler'. If false, then Bazel does not
    perform a system call.
  --system_rc: Whether or not to look for the system-wide bazelrc.
  --unlimit_coredumps: Raises the soft coredump limit to the hard limit to make coredumps
    of the server (including the JVM) and the client possible under common conditions.
    Stick this flag in your bazelrc once and forget about it so that you get coredumps
    when you actually encounter a condition that triggers them.
  --client_debug: If true, log debug information from the client to stderr. Changing
    this option will not cause the server to restart.
  --home_rc: Whether or not to look for the home bazelrc file at `$HOME/.bazelrc`
  --batch: If set, Bazel will be run as just a client process without a server, instead
    of in the standard client/server mode. This is deprecated and will be removed,
    please prefer shutting down the server explicitly if you wish to avoid lingering
    servers.
  --host_jvm_debug=: Convenience option to add some additional JVM startup flags,
    which cause the JVM to wait during startup until you connect from a JDWP-compliant
    debugger (like Eclipse) to port 5005.
  --max_idle_secs=: <integer>The number of seconds the build server will wait idling
    before shutting down. Zero means that the server will never shutdown. This is
    only read on server-startup, changing this option will not cause the server to
    restart.
  --nohome_rc: Whether or not to look for the home bazelrc file at `$HOME/.bazelrc`
  --invocation_policy=: A base64-encoded-binary-serialized or text-formated invocation_policy.InvocationPolicy
    proto. Unlike other options, it is an error to specify --invocation_policy multiple
    times.
  --write_command_log: 'WARNING: This option is deprecated and will be removed soon.
    Please use the command option instead.'
  --output_user_root=: <path>The user-specific directory beneath which all build outputs
    are written; by default, this is a function of $USER, but by specifying a constant,
    build outputs can be shared between collaborating users.
  --output_base=: '<path>If set, specifies the output location to which all build
    output will be written. Otherwise, the location will be ${OUTPUT_ROOT}/_blaze_${USER}/${MD5_OF_WORKSPACE_ROOT}.
    Note: If you specify a different option from one to the next Bazel invocation
    for this value, you''ll likely start up a new, additional Bazel server. Bazel
    starts exactly one server per specified output base. Typically there is one output
    base per workspace - however, with this option you may have multiple output bases
    per workspace and thereby run multiple builds for the same client on the same
    machine concurrently. See ''bazel help shutdown'' on how to shutdown a Bazel server.'
  --experimental_cgroup_parent=: <path>The cgroup where to start the bazel server
    as an absolute path. The server process will be started in the specified cgroup
    for each supported controller. For example, if the value of this flag is /build/bazel
    and the cpu and memory controllers are mounted respectively on /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu
    and /sys/fs/cgroup/memory, the server will be started in the cgroups /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/build/bazel
    and /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/build/bazel.It is not an error if the specified cgroup
    is not writable for one or more of the controllers. This options does not have
    any effect on platforms that do not support cgroups.
  --host_jvm_args*=: <jvm_arg>Flags to pass to the JVM executing Blaze.
  --nolock_install_base: Whether the server should hold a lock on the install base
    while running, to prevent another server from attempting to garbage collect it.
  --nofatal_event_bus_exceptions: Whether or not to exit if an exception is thrown
    by an internal EventBus handler. No-op if --fatal_async_exceptions_exclusions
    is available; that flag's behavior is preferentially used.
  --nobatch_cpu_scheduling: Only on Linux; use 'batch' CPU scheduling for Blaze. This
    policy is useful for workloads that are non-interactive, but do not want to lower
    their nice value. See 'man 2 sched_setscheduler'. If false, then Bazel does not
    perform a system call.
  --extra_classpath=: A colon-separated list of classpath entries to be added to the
    classpath of the Bazel server.
  --unix_digest_hash_attribute_name=: The name of an extended attribute that can be
    placed on files to store a precomputed copy of the file's hash, corresponding
    with --digest_function. This option can be used to reduce disk I/O and CPU load
    caused by hash computation. This extended attribute is checked on all source files
    and output files, meaning that it causes a significant number of invocations of
    the getxattr() system call.
  --experimental_run_in_user_cgroup: If true, the Bazel server will be run with systemd-run,
    and the user will own the cgroup. This flag only takes effect on Linux.
  --workspace_directory=: The root of the workspace, that is, the directory that Bazel
    uses as the root of the build. This flag is only to be set by the bazel client.
  --option_sources=: ''
  --noexperimental_run_in_user_cgroup: If true, the Bazel server will be run with
    systemd-run, and the user will own the cgroup. This flag only takes effect on
    Linux.
  --noblock_for_lock: When --noblock_for_lock is passed, Bazel does not wait for a
    running command to complete, but instead exits immediately.
  --shutdown_on_low_sys_mem: If max_idle_secs is set and the build server has been
    idle for a while, shut down the server when the system is low on free RAM. Linux
    and MacOS only.
  --digest_function=: The hash function to use when computing file digests.
  --product_name=: The name of the build system. It is used as part of the name of
    the generated directories (e.g. productName-bin for binaries) as well as for printing
    error messages and logging
  --io_nice_level=: '{-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}Only on Linux; set a level from 0-7 for best-effort
    IO scheduling using the sys_ioprio_set system call. 0 is highest priority, 7 is
    lowest. The anticipatory scheduler may only honor up to priority 4. If set to
    a negative value, then Bazel does not perform a system call.'
  --nobatch: If set, Bazel will be run as just a client process without a server,
    instead of in the standard client/server mode. This is deprecated and will be
    removed, please prefer shutting down the server explicitly if you wish to avoid
    lingering servers.
  --bazelrc*=: |
    <path>The location of the user .bazelrc file containing default values of Bazel options.
    `/dev/null` indicates that all further `--bazelrc`s will be ignored, which is useful to
    disable the search for a user rc file, e.g. in release builds.

    This option can also be specified multiple times. e.g. with
    `--bazelrc=x.rc --bazelrc=y.rc --bazelrc=/dev/null --bazelrc=z.rc`.
    1. `x.rc` and `y.rc` are read.
    2. `z.rc` is ignored due to the prior `/dev/null`.
    If unspecified, Bazel uses the first `.bazelrc` file it finds in
    the following two locations: the workspace directory, then the user's home
    directory.

    Note: command line options will always supersede any option in bazelrc.
description: build system
commands:
- name: aquery
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --include_file_write_contents: 'Include the file contents for the FileWrite, SourceSymlinkManifest,
      and RepoMappingManifest actions (potentially large). '
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --output=: 'The format in which the aquery results should be printed. Allowed
      values for aquery are: text, textproto, proto, streamed_proto, jsonproto.'
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --include_pruned_inputs: Includes action inputs that were pruned during action
      execution. Only affects actions that discover inputs and have been executed
      in a previous invocation. Only takes effect if --include_artifacts is also set.
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --noinclude_artifacts: Includes names of the action inputs and outputs in the
      output (potentially large).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --noinclude_pruned_inputs: Includes action inputs that were pruned during action
      execution. Only affects actions that discover inputs and have been executed
      in a previous invocation. Only takes effect if --include_artifacts is also set.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --noinclude_param_files: 'Include the content of the param files used in the command
      (potentially large). Note: Enabling this flag will automatically enable the
      --include_commandline flag.'
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --include_commandline: Includes the content of the action command lines in the
      output (potentially large).
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --skyframe_state: 'Without performing extra analysis, dump the current Action
      Graph from Skyframe. Note: Specifying a target with --skyframe_state is currently
      not supported. This flag is only available with --output=proto or --output=textproto.'
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --noinclude_commandline: Includes the content of the action command lines in the
      output (potentially large).
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --include_param_files: 'Include the content of the param files used in the command
      (potentially large). Note: Enabling this flag will automatically enable the
      --include_commandline flag.'
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noskyframe_state: 'Without performing extra analysis, dump the current Action
      Graph from Skyframe. Note: Specifying a target with --skyframe_state is currently
      not supported. This flag is only available with --output=proto or --output=textproto.'
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --noinclude_file_write_contents: 'Include the file contents for the FileWrite,
      SourceSymlinkManifest, and RepoMappingManifest actions (potentially large). '
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --include_artifacts: Includes names of the action inputs and outputs in the output
      (potentially large).
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Analyzes the given targets and queries the action graph.
- name: build
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Builds the specified targets.
- name: canonicalize-flags
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --canonicalize_policy: Output the canonical policy, after expansion and filtering.
      To keep the output clean, the canonicalized command arguments will NOT be shown
      when this option is set to true. Note that the command specified by --for_command
      affects the filtered policy, and if none is specified, the default command is
      'build'.
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_include_default_values: Whether Starlark options set to their default
      values are included in the output.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --invocation_policy=: Applies an invocation policy to the options to be canonicalized.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --for_command=: The command for which the options should be canonicalized.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --noexperimental_include_default_values: Whether Starlark options set to their
      default values are included in the output.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --nocanonicalize_policy: Output the canonical policy, after expansion and filtering.
      To keep the output clean, the canonicalized command arguments will NOT be shown
      when this option is set to true. Note that the command specified by --for_command
      affects the filtered policy, and if none is specified, the default command is
      'build'.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Canonicalizes a list of %{product} options.
- name: clean
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --async: If true, output cleaning is asynchronous. When this command completes,
      it will be safe to execute new commands in the same client, even though the
      deletion may continue in the background.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noasync: If true, output cleaning is asynchronous. When this command completes,
      it will be safe to execute new commands in the same client, even though the
      deletion may continue in the background.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --noexpunge: If true, clean removes the entire working tree for this %{product}
      instance, which includes all %{product}-created temporary and build output files,
      and stops the %{product} server if it is running.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --expunge_async=: If specified, clean asynchronously removes the entire working
      tree for this %{product} instance, which includes all %{product}-created temporary
      and build output files, and stops the %{product} server if it is running. When
      this command completes, it will be safe to execute new commands in the same
      client, even though the deletion may continue in the background.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --expunge: If true, clean removes the entire working tree for this %{product}
      instance, which includes all %{product}-created temporary and build output files,
      and stops the %{product} server if it is running.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Removes output files and optionally stops the server.
- name: config
  flags:
    --dump_all: If set, dump all known configurations instead of just the ids.
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --output=: 'Formats the output of displayed results. Can be one of: ''text'',
      ''json''. '
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --nodump_all: If set, dump all known configurations instead of just the ids.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Displays details of configurations.
- name: coverage
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --notest_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the
      actual test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --noverbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the actual
      test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --verbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --print_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --noprint_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Generates code coverage report for specified test targets.
- name: cquery
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --output=: 'The format in which the cquery results should be printed. Allowed
      values for cquery are: label, label_kind, textproto, transitions, proto, streamed_proto,
      jsonproto. If you select ''transitions'', you also have to specify the --transitions=(lite|full)
      option.'
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --proto:include_configurations: if enabled, proto output will include information
      about configurations. When disabled,cquery proto output format resembles query
      output format.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --starlark:file=: The name of a file that defines a Starlark function called 'format',
      of one argument, that is applied to each configured target to format it as a
      string. It is an error to specify both --starlark:expr and --starlark:file.
      See help for --output=starlark for additional detail.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --notest_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the
      actual test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --noverbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the actual
      test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --noproto:include_configurations: if enabled, proto output will include information
      about configurations. When disabled,cquery proto output format resembles query
      output format.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --verbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --print_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --noprint_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --show_config_fragments=: Shows the configuration fragments required by a rule
      and its transitive dependencies. This can be useful for evaluating how much
      a configured target graph can be trimmed.
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --transitions=: The format in which cquery will print transition information.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --starlark:expr=: A Starlark expression to format each configured target in cquery's
      --output=starlark mode. The configured target is bound to 'target'. If neither
      --starlark:expr nor --starlark:file is specified, this option will default to
      'str(target.label)'. It is an error to specify both --starlark:expr and --starlark:file.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.

  description: Dumps the internal state of the %{product} server process.
- name: fetch
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --noall: |
      Fetches all external repositories necessary for building any target or repository.
      This is the default if no other flags and arguments are provided. Only works
      when `--enable_bzlmod` is on.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --notest_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the
      actual test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --force: |
      Ignore existing repository if any and force fetch the repository again. Only works when
      `--enable_bzlmod` is on.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --noverbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the actual
      test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --configure: |
      Only fetches repositories marked as `configure` for system-configuration purpose. Only
      works when `--enable_bzlmod` is on.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --verbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --print_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --all: |
      Fetches all external repositories necessary for building any target or repository.
      This is the default if no other flags and arguments are provided. Only works
      when `--enable_bzlmod` is on.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --noprint_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --repo*=: |
      Only fetches the specified repository, which can be either `@apparent_repo_name` or
      `@@canonical_repo_name`. Only works when `--enable_bzlmod` is on.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --noconfigure: |
      Only fetches repositories marked as `configure` for system-configuration purpose. Only
      works when `--enable_bzlmod` is on.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noforce: |
      Ignore existing repository if any and force fetch the repository again. Only works when
      `--enable_bzlmod` is on.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Fetches external repositories that are prerequisites to the targets.
- name: help
  flags: {--help_verbosity=: Select the verbosity of the help command., --short=: 'Show
      only the names of the options, not their types or meanings.', '-l, --long=': 'Show
      full description of each option, instead of just its name.'}
  description: Prints help for commands, or the index.
- name: info
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --info_output_type=: If stdout, results are directly printed to the console. If
      response_proto, the info command results are packed in response extensions.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --noshow_make_env: Include the "Make" environment in the output.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --show_make_env: Include the "Make" environment in the output.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Displays runtime info about the %{product} server.
- name: license
  flags: {}
  description: Prints the license of this software.
- name: mobile-install
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --adb_arg*=: Extra arguments to pass to adb. Usually used to designate a device
      to install to.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --mode=: Deprecated no-effect flag. Only skylark mode is still supported.
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --start=: How the app should be started after installing it. Set to WARM to preserve
      and restore application state on incremental installs.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --adb=: adb binary to use for the 'mobile-install' command. If unspecified, the
      one in the Android SDK specified by the --android_sdk_channel command line option
      (or  the default SDK if --android_sdk_channel is not specified) is used.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --device=: The adb device serial number. If not specified, the first device will
      be used.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --norun_in_client: If true, the mobile-install deployer command will be sent to
      the bazel client for execution. Useful for configurations where the bazel client
      is on a different machine than the bazel server.
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    --debug_app=: Whether to wait for the debugger before starting the app.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --mobile_install_aspect=: The aspect to use for mobile-install.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --run_in_client: If true, the mobile-install deployer command will be sent to
      the bazel client for execution. Useful for configurations where the bazel client
      is on a different machine than the bazel server.
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --start_app=: Whether to start the app after installing it.
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --noincremental: Whether to do an incremental install. If true, try to avoid unnecessary
      additional work by reading the state of the device the code is to be installed
      on and using that information to avoid unnecessary work. If false (the default),
      always do a full install.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --split_apks: Whether to use split apks to install and update the application
      on the device. Works only with devices with Marshmallow or later
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --incremental_install_verbosity=: The verbosity for incremental install. Set to
      1 for debug logging.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --nosplit_apks: Whether to use split apks to install and update the application
      on the device. Works only with devices with Marshmallow or later
    --incremental: Whether to do an incremental install. If true, try to avoid unnecessary
      additional work by reading the state of the device the code is to be installed
      on and using that information to avoid unnecessary work. If false (the default),
      always do a full install.
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --mobile_install_supported_rules=: The supported rules for mobile-install.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.

- name: mod
  flags:
    --incompatible_bep_cpu_from_platform: If specified, the value of the cpu constraint
      (@platforms//cpu:cpu) of the target platform is used to set the Configuration.cpu
      and Configuration.platform_name fields in the BEP.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --instrument_test_targets: |
      When coverage is enabled, specifies whether to consider instrumenting test rules.
      When set, test rules included by `--instrumentation_filter` are instrumented.
      Otherwise, test rules are always excluded from coverage instrumentation.
    --noinstrument_test_targets: |
      When coverage is enabled, specifies whether to consider instrumenting test rules.
      When set, test rules included by `--instrumentation_filter` are instrumented.
      Otherwise, test rules are always excluded from coverage instrumentation.
    --incompatible_bazel_test_exec_run_under: |
      If enabled, `bazel test --run_under=//:runner` builds `//:runner` in the exec
      configuration. If disabled, it builds `//:runner` in the target configuration.
      Bazel executes tests on exec machines, so the former is more correct. This
      doesn't affect `bazel run`, which always builds `--run_under=//foo` in the
      target configuration.
    --depth=: |
      Maximum display depth of the dependency tree. A depth of 1 displays the direct
      dependencies, for example. For `tree`, `path` and `all_paths` it defaults to
      `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, while for `deps` and `explain` it defaults to 1 (only displays
      direct deps of the root besides the target leaves and their parents).
    --noenforce_constraints: Checks the environments each target is compatible with
      and reports errors if any target has dependencies that don't support the same
      environments
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive: |
      When enabled, passing multiple `--modify_execution_info` flags is additive.
      When disabled, only the last flag is taken into account.
    --noverbose: The queries will also display the reason why modules were resolved
      to their current version (if changed). Defaults to true only for the explain
      query.
    --output=: |
      The format in which the query results should be printed. Allowed values for query are:
      `text`, `json`, `graph`.
    --incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform: |
      If specified, the value of the cpu constraint (`@platforms//cpu:cpu`) of
      the target platform is used to set the `$(TARGET_CPU)` make variable.
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_output_directory_naming_scheme=: |
      Please only use this flag as part of a suggested migration or testing strategy. In
      `legacy` mode, transitions (generally only Starlark) set and use `affected by Starlark transition`
      to determine the ST hash. In `diff_against_baseline` mode,
      `affected by Starlark transition` is ignored and instead ST hash is determined,
      for all configuration, by diffing against the top-level configuration.
    --noexperimental_allow_map_directory: If enabled, Bazel allows the use of ctx.actions.map_directory().
      This allows for the creation of actions based on the files in a directory through
      a user defined Starlark function and a <code>template_ctx</code> that supports
      basic action generation APIs.
    --noverbose_visibility_errors: If enabled, visibility errors include additional
      diagnostic information.
    --experimental_action_listener*=: |
      Deprecated in favor of aspects. Use `action_listener` to attach an `extra_action` to
      existing build actions.
    --noexperimental_throttle_action_cache_check: Whether to throttle the check whether
      an action is cached.
    --experimental_strict_fileset_output: If this option is enabled, filesets will
      treat all output artifacts as regular files. They will not traverse directories
      or be sensitive to symlinks.
    --experimental_exclude_defines_from_exec_config: |
      If true, don't propagate `--define`s to the exec transition at default; only propagate
      defines specified by `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag`.
    --noall_repos: |
      For `mod show_repo`: display all repos in the entire workspace.
    --include_builtin: Include built-in modules in the dependency graph. Disabled
      by default because it is quite noisy.
    --noallow_analysis_failures: |
      If true, an analysis failure of a rule target results in the target's propagation
      of an instance of `AnalysisFailureInfo` containing the error description, instead
      of resulting in a build failure.
    --allow_unresolved_symlinks: |
      If enabled, Bazel allows the use of `ctx.action.declare_symlink()` and the use of
      `ctx.actions.symlink()` without a target file, thus allowing the creation of
      unresolved symlinks.

      Unresolved symlinks inside tree artifacts are not currently supported.
    --target_environment*=: |
      Declares this build's target environment. Must be a label reference to an
      [`environment` rule]. If specified, all top-level targets must be compatible with this
      environment.

      See also `--platforms`.

      [`environment` rule]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/constraints/EnvironmentRule.java
    --from=: |
      The module(s) starting from which the dependency graph query will be displayed. Check
      each query’s description for the exact semantics. Defaults to `<root>`.
    --allowed_cpu_values=: Allowed values for the `--cpu` flag.
    --noexperimental_writable_outputs: If true, the file permissions of action outputs
      are set to `0755` instead of `0555`
    --define*=: |
      Each `--define` option specifies an assignment for a build variable.
      In case of multiple values for a variable, the last one wins.
    --min_param_file_size=: Minimum command line length before creating a parameter
      file.
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --build_runfile_manifests: If true, write runfiles manifests for all targets.
      If false, omit them. Local tests will fail to run when false.
    --noincompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest: |
      If enabled, the `{binary}.repo_mapping` file emits a module extension's repo mapping
      only once instead of once for each repo generated by the extension that
      contributes runfiles.
    --noexperimental_extended_sanity_checks: Enables internal validation checks to
      make sure that configured target implementations only access things they should.
      Causes a performance hit.
    --include_config_fragments_provider=: |
      INTERNAL BLAZE DEVELOPER FEATURE: If `direct`, all configured targets expose
      RequiredConfigFragmentsProvider with the configuration fragments they directly
      require.
      If `transitive`, they do the same but also include the fragments their
      transitive dependencies require. If `off`, the provider is omitted.

      If not `off`, this also populates `config_setting`'s
      `ConfigMatchingProvider.requiredFragmentOptions` with the fragment options the
      `config_setting` requires.

      Be careful using this feature: it adds memory to every configured target in the
      build.
    --cycles: Points out dependency cycles inside the displayed tree.
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_debug_selects_always_succeed: |
      When set, `select` functions with no matching clause will return an empty value, instead
      of failing. This is to help use `cquery` diagnose failures in `select`.
    --all_repos: |
      For `mod show_repo`: display all repos in the entire workspace.
    --nocheck_visibility: If disabled, visibility errors in target dependencies are
      demoted to warnings.
    --run_under=: |
      Prefix to insert before the executables for the `test` and `run` commands.
      If the value is `foo -bar`, and the execution command line is `test_binary -baz`,
      then the final command line is `foo -bar test_binary -baz`.
      This can also be a label to an executable target. Some examples are:
      - `valgrind`
      - `strace`
      - `strace -c`
      - `valgrind --quiet --num-callers=20`
      - `//package:target`
      - `//package:target --options`
    --check_visibility: If disabled, visibility errors in target dependencies are
      demoted to warnings.
    --incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest: |
      If enabled, the `{binary}.repo_mapping` file emits a module extension's repo mapping
      only once instead of once for each repo generated by the extension that
      contributes runfiles.
    --nocheck_licenses: Deprecated in favor of `--config=check_licenses`.
    --cpu=: |
      Deprecated: this flag is not used internally by Blaze although there are legacy platform
      mappings to allow for backwards compatibility. Do not use this flag, instead use
      `--platforms` with an appropriate platform definition.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --experimental_exec_config=: |
      If set to `//some:label:my.bzl%my_transition`, uses my_transition for `cfg = "exec"`
      semantics instead of Bazel's internal exec transition logic. Else uses Bazel's
      internal logic.
    --analysis_testing_deps_limit=: |
      Sets the maximum number of transitive dependencies through a rule attribute with
      a `for_analysis_testing` configuration transition.
      Exceeding this limit will result in a rule error.
    --experimental_writable_outputs: If true, the file permissions of action outputs
      are set to `0755` instead of `0555`
    --noinclude_builtin: Include built-in modules in the dependency graph. Disabled
      by default because it is quite noisy.
    --experimental_use_platforms_in_output_dir_legacy_heuristic: |
      Please only use this flag as part of a suggested migration or testing strategy. Note
      that the heuristic has known deficiencies and it is suggested to migrate to
      relying on just `--experimental_override_name_platform_in_output_dir`.
    --archived_tree_artifact_mnemonics_filter=: Regex filter for mnemonics of actions
      for which we should create archived tree artifacts. This option is a no-op for
      actions which do not generate tree artifacts.
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --noincompatible_check_testonly_for_output_files: If enabled, check testonly for
      prerequisite targets that are output files by looking up the testonly of the
      generating rule. This matches visibility checking.
    -c, --compilation_mode=: 'Specify the mode the binary will be built in. Values:
      `fastbuild`, `dbg`, `opt`.'
    --noexperimental_exclude_defines_from_exec_config: |
      If true, don't propagate `--define`s to the exec transition at default; only propagate
      defines specified by `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag`.
    --host_action_env*=: |
      Specifies the set of environment variables available to actions with execution
      configurations. Variables can be either specified by `name`, in which case the
      value will be taken from the invocation environment, by the `name=value` pair
      which sets the value independent of the invocation environment, or by
      `=name`, which unsets the variable of that name. This option can
      be used multiple times; for options given for the same variable, the latest
      wins, options for different variables accumulate.
    --incompatible_merge_genfiles_directory: If true, the genfiles directory is folded
      into the bin directory.
    --all_visible_repos: |
      For `mod show_repo`: display all repos visible to the chosen base module, under their apparent names.
    --experimental_platform_in_output_dir=: |
      If true, a shortname for the target platform is used in the output directory name
      instead of the CPU. The exact scheme is experimental and subject to change:
      1. First, in the rare case the `--platforms` option does not have exactly one value, a
         hash of the platforms option is used.
      2. Next, if any shortname for the current platform was registered by
         `--experimental_override_name_platform_in_output_dir`, then that shortname is used.
      3. Then, if `--experimental_use_platforms_in_output_dir_legacy_heuristic` is set, use a
         shortname based off the current platform Label.
      4. Finally, a hash of the platform option is used as a last resort.
    --experimental_override_platform_cpu_name*=: |
      Each entry should be of the form `label=value` where label refers to a platform and values
      is the desired shortname to override the platform's CPU name in `$(TARGET_CPU)`
      make variable and output path. Only used when
      `--experimental_platform_in_output_dir`, `--incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform` or
      `--incompatible_bep_cpu_from_platform` is true. Has highest naming priority.
    --platform_suffix=: Specifies a suffix to be added to the configuration directory.
    --modify_execution_info*=: |
      Add or remove keys from an action's execution info based on action mnemonic.
      Applies only to actions which support execution info. Many common actions
      support execution info, e.g. Genrule, CppCompile, Javac, StarlarkAction,
      TestRunner. When specifying multiple values, order matters because
      many regexes may apply to the same mnemonic.

      Syntax: `regex=[+-]key,regex=[+-]key,...`.

      Examples:
      - `.*=+x,.*=-y,.*=+z` adds `x` and `z` to, and removes `y` from, the execution info for all actions.
      - `Genrule=+requires-x` adds `requires-x` to the execution info for all Genrule actions.
      - `(?!Genrule).*=-requires-x` removes `requires-x` from the execution info for all non-Genrule actions.
    --noexperimental_remotable_source_manifests: Whether to make source manifest actions
      remotable
    --verbose: The queries will also display the reason why modules were resolved
      to their current version (if changed). Defaults to true only for the explain
      query.
    --nostrict_filesets: If this option is enabled, filesets crossing package boundaries
      are reported as errors.
    --experimental_propagate_custom_flag*=: |
      Which custom flags (starlark flags or defines) to propagate to the exec transition, by
      key. e.g. if `--define=a=b` should be propagated, set
      `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag=a`
    --incompatible_check_testonly_for_output_files: If enabled, check testonly for
      prerequisite targets that are output files by looking up the testonly of the
      generating rule. This matches visibility checking.
    --extension_usages=: Specify modules whose extension usages will be displayed
      in the show_extension query.
    --nobuild_runfile_manifests: If true, write runfiles manifests for all targets.
      If false, omit them. Local tests will fail to run when false.
    --host_cpu=: The host CPU.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --nostamp: Stamp binaries with the date, username, hostname, workspace information,
      etc.
    --nocollect_code_coverage: |
      If specified, Bazel will instrument code (using offline instrumentation where
      possible) and will collect coverage information during tests. Only targets that
      match `--instrumentation_filter` will be affected. Usually this option should
      not be specified directly - `bazel coverage` command should be used instead.
    --features*=: |
      The given features will be enabled or disabled by default for targets built in the target configuration.
      Specifying `-{feature}` will disable the feature. Negative features always override positive ones.
      See also `--host_features`.
    --nouse_target_platform_for_tests: If true, use the target platform for running
      tests rather than the test exec group.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noexperimental_collect_code_coverage_for_generated_files: If specified, Bazel
      will also generate collect coverage information for generated files.
    --collect_code_coverage: |
      If specified, Bazel will instrument code (using offline instrumentation where
      possible) and will collect coverage information during tests. Only targets that
      match `--instrumentation_filter` will be affected. Usually this option should
      not be specified directly - `bazel coverage` command should be used instead.
    --noincompatible_exclude_starlark_flags_from_exec_config: If true, don't propagate
      starlark flags to the exec transition at default; only propagate starlark flags
      specified in `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag`.
    --experimental_output_paths=: |
      Which model to use for where in the output tree rules write their outputs, particularly
      for multi-platform / multi-configuration builds. This is highly experimental. See
      [GH-6526] for details. Starlark actions can opt into path mapping by adding the key
      `supports-path-mapping` to the `execution_requirements` dict.

      [GH-6526]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6526
    --extension_filter=: Only display the usages of these module extensions and the
      repos generated by them if their respective flags are set. If set, the result
      graph will only include paths that contain modules using the specified extensions.
      An empty list disables the filter, effectively specifying all possible extensions.
    --noincompatible_bep_cpu_from_platform: If specified, the value of the cpu constraint
      (@platforms//cpu:cpu) of the target platform is used to set the Configuration.cpu
      and Configuration.platform_name fields in the BEP.
    --enable_runfiles=: Enable runfiles symlink tree; By default, it's off on Windows,
      on on other platforms.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --nobuild_runfile_links: If true, build runfiles symlink forests for all targets.  If
      false, write them only when required by a local action, test or run command.
    --exec_aspects*=: Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to exec-configured
      targets, regardless of whether or not they are top-level targets. This is an
      experimental feature and is subject to change.
    --noall_visible_repos: |
      For `mod show_repo`: display all repos visible to the chosen base module, under their apparent names.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_use_platforms_in_output_dir_legacy_heuristic: |
      Please only use this flag as part of a suggested migration or testing strategy. Note
      that the heuristic has known deficiencies and it is suggested to migrate to
      relying on just `--experimental_override_name_platform_in_output_dir`.
    --charset=: |
      Chooses the character set to use for the tree. Only affects text output. Valid values
      are `utf8` or `ascii`. Default is `utf8`
    --experimental_debug_selects_always_succeed: |
      When set, `select` functions with no matching clause will return an empty value, instead
      of failing. This is to help use `cquery` diagnose failures in `select`.
    --nocycles: Points out dependency cycles inside the displayed tree.
    --noexperimental_strict_fileset_output: If this option is enabled, filesets will
      treat all output artifacts as regular files. They will not traverse directories
      or be sensitive to symlinks.
    --noincompatible_always_include_files_in_data: |
      If true, native rules add `DefaultInfo.files` of data dependencies to their runfiles,
      which matches the recommended behavior for Starlark rules ([runfiles features to avoid]).

      [runfiles features to avoid]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#runfiles_features_to_avoid
    --experimental_enforce_transitive_visibility: If true, enable package()s to set
      the transitive_visibility attribute to restrict which packages may depend on
      them.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --host_features*=: |
      The given features will be enabled or disabled by default for targets built in the exec configuration.
      Specifying `-{feature}` will disable the feature. Negative features always override positive ones.
    --noinclude_unused: |
      The queries will also take into account and display the unused modules, which are not
      present in the module resolution graph after selection (due to the
      Minimal-Version Selection or override rules). This can have different effects for
      each of the query types i.e. include new paths in the `all_paths` command, or extra
      dependants in the `explain` command.
    --incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data: If true, runfiles of targets listed
      in the srcs attribute are available to targets that consume the filegroup as
      a data dependency.
    --noincompatible_modify_execution_info_additive: |
      When enabled, passing multiple `--modify_execution_info` flags is additive.
      When disabled, only the last flag is taken into account.
    --experimental_remotable_source_manifests: Whether to make source manifest actions
      remotable
    --incompatible_auto_exec_groups: |
      When enabled, an exec groups is automatically created for each toolchain used by a rule.
      For this to work rule needs to specify `toolchain` parameter on its actions. For
      more information, see [GH-17134].

      [GH-17134]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17134
    --noincompatible_merge_genfiles_directory: If true, the genfiles directory is
      folded into the bin directory.
    --incompatible_limit_platforms_in_output_dir_to=: Added for gradual rollout of
      --experimental_platform_in_output_dir to non-exec configurations. Takes a comma-separated
      list of platform labels. If set, --experimental_platform_in_output_dir is only
      enabled for platforms in this list. Otherwise, --experimental_platform_in_output_dir
      applies to all platforms.
    --check_licenses: Deprecated in favor of `--config=check_licenses`.
    --use_target_platform_for_tests: If true, use the target platform for running
      tests rather than the test exec group.
    --flag_alias*=: |
      Sets a shorthand name for a Starlark flag. It takes a single key-value pair in the form
      `{key}={value}` as an argument.
    --noincompatible_auto_exec_groups: |
      When enabled, an exec groups is automatically created for each toolchain used by a rule.
      For this to work rule needs to specify `toolchain` parameter on its actions. For
      more information, see [GH-17134].

      [GH-17134]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17134
    --noexperimental_enforce_transitive_visibility: If true, enable package()s to
      set the transitive_visibility attribute to restrict which packages may depend
      on them.
    --enforce_constraints: Checks the environments each target is compatible with
      and reports errors if any target has dependencies that don't support the same
      environments
    --incompatible_disable_select_on=: List of flags for which the use in `select()`
      is disabled.
    --include_unused: |
      The queries will also take into account and display the unused modules, which are not
      present in the module resolution graph after selection (due to the
      Minimal-Version Selection or override rules). This can have different effects for
      each of the query types i.e. include new paths in the `all_paths` command, or extra
      dependants in the `explain` command.
    --experimental_throttle_action_cache_check: Whether to throttle the check whether
      an action is cached.
    --experimental_collect_code_coverage_for_generated_files: If specified, Bazel
      will also generate collect coverage information for generated files.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --incompatible_always_include_files_in_data: |
      If true, native rules add `DefaultInfo.files` of data dependencies to their runfiles,
      which matches the recommended behavior for Starlark rules ([runfiles features to avoid]).

      [runfiles features to avoid]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#runfiles_features_to_avoid
    --noincompatible_bazel_test_exec_run_under: |
      If enabled, `bazel test --run_under=//:runner` builds `//:runner` in the exec
      configuration. If disabled, it builds `//:runner` in the target configuration.
      Bazel executes tests on exec machines, so the former is more correct. This
      doesn't affect `bazel run`, which always builds `--run_under=//foo` in the
      target configuration.
    --extension_info=: |
      Specify how much detail about extension usages to include in the query result.
      - `hidden` will not show any extension information.
      - `usages` will only show the extensions names.
      - `repos` will also include repos imported with `use_repo`.
      - `all` will also show the other repositories generated by extensions.
    --action_env*=: |
      Specifies the set of environment variables available to actions with target
      configuration. Variables can be either specified by `name`, in which case
      the value will be taken from the invocation environment, by the `name=value`
      pair which sets the value independent of the invocation environment, or by
      `=name`, which unsets the variable of that name. This option can be used
      multiple times; for options given for the same variable, the latest wins,
      options for different variables accumulate.

      Note that unless `--incompatible_repo_env_ignores_action_env` is true, all `name=value`
      pairs will be available to repository rules.
    --incompatible_exclude_starlark_flags_from_exec_config: If true, don't propagate
      starlark flags to the exec transition at default; only propagate starlark flags
      specified in `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag`.
    --allow_analysis_failures: |
      If true, an analysis failure of a rule target results in the target's propagation
      of an instance of `AnalysisFailureInfo` containing the error description, instead
      of resulting in a build failure.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --host_compilation_mode=: |
      Specify the mode the tools used during the build will be built in. Values:
      `fastbuild`, `dbg`, `opt`.
    --verbose_visibility_errors: If enabled, visibility errors include additional
      diagnostic information.
    --base_module=: Specify a module relative to which the specified target repos
      will be interpreted.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --experimental_exec_configuration_distinguisher=: |
      Please only use this flag as part of a suggested migration or testing strategy due to
      potential for action conflicts. Controls how the execution transition changes the
      `--platform_suffix` flag. In `legacy` mode, sets it to a hash of the execution
      platform. In `fullhash` mode, sets it to a hash of the entire configuration. In `off`
      mode, does not touch it.
    --stamp: Stamp binaries with the date, username, hostname, workspace information,
      etc.
    --instrumentation_filter=: |
      When coverage is enabled, only rules with names included by the
      specified regex-based filter will be instrumented. Rules prefixed
      with '-' are excluded instead. Note that only non-test rules are
      instrumented unless `--instrument_test_targets` is enabled.
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_extended_sanity_checks: Enables internal validation checks to make
      sure that configured target implementations only access things they should.
      Causes a performance hit.
    --noincompatible_target_cpu_from_platform: |
      If specified, the value of the cpu constraint (`@platforms//cpu:cpu`) of
      the target platform is used to set the `$(TARGET_CPU)` make variable.
    --strict_filesets: If this option is enabled, filesets crossing package boundaries
      are reported as errors.
    --noallow_unresolved_symlinks: |
      If enabled, Bazel allows the use of `ctx.action.declare_symlink()` and the use of
      `ctx.actions.symlink()` without a target file, thus allowing the creation of
      unresolved symlinks.

      Unresolved symlinks inside tree artifacts are not currently supported.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --build_runfile_links: If true, build runfiles symlink forests for all targets.  If
      false, write them only when required by a local action, test or run command.
    --scl_config=: Name of the scl config defined in PROJECT.scl. Note that this feature
      is still under development b/324119879.
    --experimental_allow_map_directory: If enabled, Bazel allows the use of ctx.actions.map_directory().
      This allows for the creation of actions based on the files in a directory through
      a user defined Starlark function and a <code>template_ctx</code> that supports
      basic action generation APIs.
    --noincompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data: If true, runfiles of targets listed
      in the srcs attribute are available to targets that consume the filegroup as
      a data dependency.
  description: Queries the Bzlmod external dependency graph
- name: print_action
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --print_action_mnemonics*=: Lists which mnemonics to filter print_action data
      by, no filtering takes place when left empty.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Prints the command line args for compiling a file.
- name: query
  flags:
    --incompatible_bep_cpu_from_platform: If specified, the value of the cpu constraint
      (@platforms//cpu:cpu) of the target platform is used to set the Configuration.cpu
      and Configuration.platform_name fields in the BEP.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --instrument_test_targets: |
      When coverage is enabled, specifies whether to consider instrumenting test rules.
      When set, test rules included by `--instrumentation_filter` are instrumented.
      Otherwise, test rules are always excluded from coverage instrumentation.
    --noinstrument_test_targets: |
      When coverage is enabled, specifies whether to consider instrumenting test rules.
      When set, test rules included by `--instrumentation_filter` are instrumented.
      Otherwise, test rules are always excluded from coverage instrumentation.
    --incompatible_bazel_test_exec_run_under: |
      If enabled, `bazel test --run_under=//:runner` builds `//:runner` in the exec
      configuration. If disabled, it builds `//:runner` in the target configuration.
      Bazel executes tests on exec machines, so the former is more correct. This
      doesn't affect `bazel run`, which always builds `--run_under=//foo` in the
      target configuration.
    --xml:line_numbers: If true, XML output contains line numbers. Disabling this
      option may make diffs easier to read.  This option is only applicable to --output=xml.
    --noenforce_constraints: Checks the environments each target is compatible with
      and reports errors if any target has dependencies that don't support the same
      environments
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --incompatible_modify_execution_info_additive: |
      When enabled, passing multiple `--modify_execution_info` flags is additive.
      When disabled, only the last flag is taken into account.
    --output=: 'The format in which the query results should be printed. Allowed values
      for query are: build, graph, streamed_jsonproto, label, label_kind, location,
      maxrank, minrank, package, proto, streamed_proto, xml.'
    --incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform: |
      If specified, the value of the cpu constraint (`@platforms//cpu:cpu`) of
      the target platform is used to set the `$(TARGET_CPU)` make variable.
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --order_results=: Output the results in dependency-ordered (default) or unordered
      fashion. The unordered output is faster but only supported when --output is
      not minrank, maxrank, or graph.
    --experimental_output_directory_naming_scheme=: |
      Please only use this flag as part of a suggested migration or testing strategy. In
      `legacy` mode, transitions (generally only Starlark) set and use `affected by Starlark transition`
      to determine the ST hash. In `diff_against_baseline` mode,
      `affected by Starlark transition` is ignored and instead ST hash is determined,
      for all configuration, by diffing against the top-level configuration.
    --noexperimental_allow_map_directory: If enabled, Bazel allows the use of ctx.actions.map_directory().
      This allows for the creation of actions based on the files in a directory through
      a user defined Starlark function and a <code>template_ctx</code> that supports
      basic action generation APIs.
    --noverbose_visibility_errors: If enabled, visibility errors include additional
      diagnostic information.
    --experimental_action_listener*=: |
      Deprecated in favor of aspects. Use `action_listener` to attach an `extra_action` to
      existing build actions.
    --noexperimental_throttle_action_cache_check: Whether to throttle the check whether
      an action is cached.
    --experimental_strict_fileset_output: If this option is enabled, filesets will
      treat all output artifacts as regular files. They will not traverse directories
      or be sensitive to symlinks.
    --experimental_exclude_defines_from_exec_config: |
      If true, don't propagate `--define`s to the exec transition at default; only propagate
      defines specified by `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag`.
    --noallow_analysis_failures: |
      If true, an analysis failure of a rule target results in the target's propagation
      of an instance of `AnalysisFailureInfo` containing the error description, instead
      of resulting in a build failure.
    --allow_unresolved_symlinks: |
      If enabled, Bazel allows the use of `ctx.action.declare_symlink()` and the use of
      `ctx.actions.symlink()` without a target file, thus allowing the creation of
      unresolved symlinks.

      Unresolved symlinks inside tree artifacts are not currently supported.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --target_environment*=: |
      Declares this build's target environment. Must be a label reference to an
      [`environment` rule]. If specified, all top-level targets must be compatible with this
      environment.

      See also `--platforms`.

      [`environment` rule]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/constraints/EnvironmentRule.java
    --allowed_cpu_values=: Allowed values for the `--cpu` flag.
    --noexperimental_writable_outputs: If true, the file permissions of action outputs
      are set to `0755` instead of `0555`
    --define*=: |
      Each `--define` option specifies an assignment for a build variable.
      In case of multiple values for a variable, the last one wins.
    --min_param_file_size=: Minimum command line length before creating a parameter
      file.
    --order_output=: Output the results unordered (no), dependency-ordered (deps),
      or fully ordered (full). The default is 'auto', meaning that results are output
      either dependency-ordered or fully ordered, depending on the output formatter
      (dependency-ordered for proto, minrank, maxrank, and graph, fully ordered for
      all others). When output is fully ordered, nodes are printed in a fully deterministic
      (total) order. First, all nodes are sorted alphabetically. Then, each node in
      the list is used as the start of a post-order depth-first search in which outgoing
      edges to unvisited nodes are traversed in alphabetical order of the successor
      nodes. Finally, nodes are printed in the reverse of the order in which they
      were visited.
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --build_runfile_manifests: If true, write runfiles manifests for all targets.
      If false, omit them. Local tests will fail to run when false.
    --noincompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest: |
      If enabled, the `{binary}.repo_mapping` file emits a module extension's repo mapping
      only once instead of once for each repo generated by the extension that
      contributes runfiles.
    --noexperimental_extended_sanity_checks: Enables internal validation checks to
      make sure that configured target implementations only access things they should.
      Causes a performance hit.
    --include_config_fragments_provider=: |
      INTERNAL BLAZE DEVELOPER FEATURE: If `direct`, all configured targets expose
      RequiredConfigFragmentsProvider with the configuration fragments they directly
      require.
      If `transitive`, they do the same but also include the fragments their
      transitive dependencies require. If `off`, the provider is omitted.

      If not `off`, this also populates `config_setting`'s
      `ConfigMatchingProvider.requiredFragmentOptions` with the fragment options the
      `config_setting` requires.

      Be careful using this feature: it adds memory to every configured target in the
      build.
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_debug_selects_always_succeed: |
      When set, `select` functions with no matching clause will return an empty value, instead
      of failing. This is to help use `cquery` diagnose failures in `select`.
    --nocheck_visibility: If disabled, visibility errors in target dependencies are
      demoted to warnings.
    --run_under=: |
      Prefix to insert before the executables for the `test` and `run` commands.
      If the value is `foo -bar`, and the execution command line is `test_binary -baz`,
      then the final command line is `foo -bar test_binary -baz`.
      This can also be a label to an executable target. Some examples are:
      - `valgrind`
      - `strace`
      - `strace -c`
      - `valgrind --quiet --num-callers=20`
      - `//package:target`
      - `//package:target --options`
    --check_visibility: If disabled, visibility errors in target dependencies are
      demoted to warnings.
    --incompatible_compact_repo_mapping_manifest: |
      If enabled, the `{binary}.repo_mapping` file emits a module extension's repo mapping
      only once instead of once for each repo generated by the extension that
      contributes runfiles.
    --nocheck_licenses: Deprecated in favor of `--config=check_licenses`.
    --cpu=: |
      Deprecated: this flag is not used internally by Blaze although there are legacy platform
      mappings to allow for backwards compatibility. Do not use this flag, instead use
      `--platforms` with an appropriate platform definition.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --incompatible_lexicographical_output: If this option is set, sorts --order_output=auto
      output in lexicographical order.
    --experimental_exec_config=: |
      If set to `//some:label:my.bzl%my_transition`, uses my_transition for `cfg = "exec"`
      semantics instead of Bazel's internal exec transition logic. Else uses Bazel's
      internal logic.
    --analysis_testing_deps_limit=: |
      Sets the maximum number of transitive dependencies through a rule attribute with
      a `for_analysis_testing` configuration transition.
      Exceeding this limit will result in a rule error.
    --experimental_writable_outputs: If true, the file permissions of action outputs
      are set to `0755` instead of `0555`
    --experimental_use_platforms_in_output_dir_legacy_heuristic: |
      Please only use this flag as part of a suggested migration or testing strategy. Note
      that the heuristic has known deficiencies and it is suggested to migrate to
      relying on just `--experimental_override_name_platform_in_output_dir`.
    --archived_tree_artifact_mnemonics_filter=: Regex filter for mnemonics of actions
      for which we should create archived tree artifacts. This option is a no-op for
      actions which do not generate tree artifacts.
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --nostrict_test_suite: If true, the tests() expression gives an error if it encounters
      a test_suite containing non-test targets.
    --noincompatible_check_testonly_for_output_files: If enabled, check testonly for
      prerequisite targets that are output files by looking up the testonly of the
      generating rule. This matches visibility checking.
    -c, --compilation_mode=: 'Specify the mode the binary will be built in. Values:
      `fastbuild`, `dbg`, `opt`.'
    --noexperimental_exclude_defines_from_exec_config: |
      If true, don't propagate `--define`s to the exec transition at default; only propagate
      defines specified by `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag`.
    --host_action_env*=: |
      Specifies the set of environment variables available to actions with execution
      configurations. Variables can be either specified by `name`, in which case the
      value will be taken from the invocation environment, by the `name=value` pair
      which sets the value independent of the invocation environment, or by
      `=name`, which unsets the variable of that name. This option can
      be used multiple times; for options given for the same variable, the latest
      wins, options for different variables accumulate.
    --incompatible_merge_genfiles_directory: If true, the genfiles directory is folded
      into the bin directory.
    --experimental_platform_in_output_dir=: |
      If true, a shortname for the target platform is used in the output directory name
      instead of the CPU. The exact scheme is experimental and subject to change:
      1. First, in the rare case the `--platforms` option does not have exactly one value, a
         hash of the platforms option is used.
      2. Next, if any shortname for the current platform was registered by
         `--experimental_override_name_platform_in_output_dir`, then that shortname is used.
      3. Then, if `--experimental_use_platforms_in_output_dir_legacy_heuristic` is set, use a
         shortname based off the current platform Label.
      4. Finally, a hash of the platform option is used as a last resort.
    --experimental_override_platform_cpu_name*=: |
      Each entry should be of the form `label=value` where label refers to a platform and values
      is the desired shortname to override the platform's CPU name in `$(TARGET_CPU)`
      make variable and output path. Only used when
      `--experimental_platform_in_output_dir`, `--incompatible_target_cpu_from_platform` or
      `--incompatible_bep_cpu_from_platform` is true. Has highest naming priority.
    --platform_suffix=: Specifies a suffix to be added to the configuration directory.
    --modify_execution_info*=: |
      Add or remove keys from an action's execution info based on action mnemonic.
      Applies only to actions which support execution info. Many common actions
      support execution info, e.g. Genrule, CppCompile, Javac, StarlarkAction,
      TestRunner. When specifying multiple values, order matters because
      many regexes may apply to the same mnemonic.

      Syntax: `regex=[+-]key,regex=[+-]key,...`.

      Examples:
      - `.*=+x,.*=-y,.*=+z` adds `x` and `z` to, and removes `y` from, the execution info for all actions.
      - `Genrule=+requires-x` adds `requires-x` to the execution info for all Genrule actions.
      - `(?!Genrule).*=-requires-x` removes `requires-x` from the execution info for all non-Genrule actions.
    --noexperimental_remotable_source_manifests: Whether to make source manifest actions
      remotable
    --nostrict_filesets: If this option is enabled, filesets crossing package boundaries
      are reported as errors.
    --experimental_propagate_custom_flag*=: |
      Which custom flags (starlark flags or defines) to propagate to the exec transition, by
      key. e.g. if `--define=a=b` should be propagated, set
      `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag=a`
    --incompatible_check_testonly_for_output_files: If enabled, check testonly for
      prerequisite targets that are output files by looking up the testonly of the
      generating rule. This matches visibility checking.
    --null=: Whether each format is terminated with \\0 instead of newline.
    --nobuild_runfile_manifests: If true, write runfiles manifests for all targets.
      If false, omit them. Local tests will fail to run when false.
    --host_cpu=: The host CPU.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --nostamp: Stamp binaries with the date, username, hostname, workspace information,
      etc.
    --nocollect_code_coverage: |
      If specified, Bazel will instrument code (using offline instrumentation where
      possible) and will collect coverage information during tests. Only targets that
      match `--instrumentation_filter` will be affected. Usually this option should
      not be specified directly - `bazel coverage` command should be used instead.
    --features*=: |
      The given features will be enabled or disabled by default for targets built in the target configuration.
      Specifying `-{feature}` will disable the feature. Negative features always override positive ones.
      See also `--host_features`.
    --nouse_target_platform_for_tests: If true, use the target platform for running
      tests rather than the test exec group.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noexperimental_collect_code_coverage_for_generated_files: If specified, Bazel
      will also generate collect coverage information for generated files.
    --collect_code_coverage: |
      If specified, Bazel will instrument code (using offline instrumentation where
      possible) and will collect coverage information during tests. Only targets that
      match `--instrumentation_filter` will be affected. Usually this option should
      not be specified directly - `bazel coverage` command should be used instead.
    --noxml:line_numbers: If true, XML output contains line numbers. Disabling this
      option may make diffs easier to read.  This option is only applicable to --output=xml.
    --noincompatible_exclude_starlark_flags_from_exec_config: If true, don't propagate
      starlark flags to the exec transition at default; only propagate starlark flags
      specified in `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag`.
    --experimental_output_paths=: |
      Which model to use for where in the output tree rules write their outputs, particularly
      for multi-platform / multi-configuration builds. This is highly experimental. See
      [GH-6526] for details. Starlark actions can opt into path mapping by adding the key
      `supports-path-mapping` to the `execution_requirements` dict.

      [GH-6526]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6526
    --noxml:default_values: If true, rule attributes whose value is not explicitly
      specified in the BUILD file are printed; otherwise they are omitted.
    --noincompatible_bep_cpu_from_platform: If specified, the value of the cpu constraint
      (@platforms//cpu:cpu) of the target platform is used to set the Configuration.cpu
      and Configuration.platform_name fields in the BEP.
    --enable_runfiles=: Enable runfiles symlink tree; By default, it's off on Windows,
      on on other platforms.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --nobuild_runfile_links: If true, build runfiles symlink forests for all targets.  If
      false, write them only when required by a local action, test or run command.
    --exec_aspects*=: Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to exec-configured
      targets, regardless of whether or not they are top-level targets. This is an
      experimental feature and is subject to change.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_use_platforms_in_output_dir_legacy_heuristic: |
      Please only use this flag as part of a suggested migration or testing strategy. Note
      that the heuristic has known deficiencies and it is suggested to migrate to
      relying on just `--experimental_override_name_platform_in_output_dir`.
    --experimental_debug_selects_always_succeed: |
      When set, `select` functions with no matching clause will return an empty value, instead
      of failing. This is to help use `cquery` diagnose failures in `select`.
    --noexperimental_strict_fileset_output: If this option is enabled, filesets will
      treat all output artifacts as regular files. They will not traverse directories
      or be sensitive to symlinks.
    --noincompatible_always_include_files_in_data: |
      If true, native rules add `DefaultInfo.files` of data dependencies to their runfiles,
      which matches the recommended behavior for Starlark rules ([runfiles features to avoid]).

      [runfiles features to avoid]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#runfiles_features_to_avoid
    --experimental_enforce_transitive_visibility: If true, enable package()s to set
      the transitive_visibility attribute to restrict which packages may depend on
      them.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --host_features*=: |
      The given features will be enabled or disabled by default for targets built in the exec configuration.
      Specifying `-{feature}` will disable the feature. Negative features always override positive ones.
    --xml:default_values: If true, rule attributes whose value is not explicitly specified
      in the BUILD file are printed; otherwise they are omitted.
    --incompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data: If true, runfiles of targets listed
      in the srcs attribute are available to targets that consume the filegroup as
      a data dependency.
    --noincompatible_modify_execution_info_additive: |
      When enabled, passing multiple `--modify_execution_info` flags is additive.
      When disabled, only the last flag is taken into account.
    --experimental_remotable_source_manifests: Whether to make source manifest actions
      remotable
    --noincompatible_lexicographical_output: If this option is set, sorts --order_output=auto
      output in lexicographical order.
    --incompatible_auto_exec_groups: |
      When enabled, an exec groups is automatically created for each toolchain used by a rule.
      For this to work rule needs to specify `toolchain` parameter on its actions. For
      more information, see [GH-17134].

      [GH-17134]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17134
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --noincompatible_merge_genfiles_directory: If true, the genfiles directory is
      folded into the bin directory.
    --incompatible_limit_platforms_in_output_dir_to=: Added for gradual rollout of
      --experimental_platform_in_output_dir to non-exec configurations. Takes a comma-separated
      list of platform labels. If set, --experimental_platform_in_output_dir is only
      enabled for platforms in this list. Otherwise, --experimental_platform_in_output_dir
      applies to all platforms.
    --strict_test_suite: If true, the tests() expression gives an error if it encounters
      a test_suite containing non-test targets.
    --check_licenses: Deprecated in favor of `--config=check_licenses`.
    --use_target_platform_for_tests: If true, use the target platform for running
      tests rather than the test exec group.
    --flag_alias*=: |
      Sets a shorthand name for a Starlark flag. It takes a single key-value pair in the form
      `{key}={value}` as an argument.
    --noincompatible_auto_exec_groups: |
      When enabled, an exec groups is automatically created for each toolchain used by a rule.
      For this to work rule needs to specify `toolchain` parameter on its actions. For
      more information, see [GH-17134].

      [GH-17134]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17134
    --graph:conditional_edges_limit=: The maximum number of condition labels to show.
      -1 means no truncation and 0 means no annotation. This option is only applicable
      to --output=graph.
    --noexperimental_enforce_transitive_visibility: If true, enable package()s to
      set the transitive_visibility attribute to restrict which packages may depend
      on them.
    --enforce_constraints: Checks the environments each target is compatible with
      and reports errors if any target has dependencies that don't support the same
      environments
    --incompatible_disable_select_on=: List of flags for which the use in `select()`
      is disabled.
    --experimental_throttle_action_cache_check: Whether to throttle the check whether
      an action is cached.
    --experimental_collect_code_coverage_for_generated_files: If specified, Bazel
      will also generate collect coverage information for generated files.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --incompatible_always_include_files_in_data: |
      If true, native rules add `DefaultInfo.files` of data dependencies to their runfiles,
      which matches the recommended behavior for Starlark rules ([runfiles features to avoid]).

      [runfiles features to avoid]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#runfiles_features_to_avoid
    --noincompatible_bazel_test_exec_run_under: |
      If enabled, `bazel test --run_under=//:runner` builds `//:runner` in the exec
      configuration. If disabled, it builds `//:runner` in the target configuration.
      Bazel executes tests on exec machines, so the former is more correct. This
      doesn't affect `bazel run`, which always builds `--run_under=//foo` in the
      target configuration.
    --action_env*=: |
      Specifies the set of environment variables available to actions with target
      configuration. Variables can be either specified by `name`, in which case
      the value will be taken from the invocation environment, by the `name=value`
      pair which sets the value independent of the invocation environment, or by
      `=name`, which unsets the variable of that name. This option can be used
      multiple times; for options given for the same variable, the latest wins,
      options for different variables accumulate.

      Note that unless `--incompatible_repo_env_ignores_action_env` is true, all `name=value`
      pairs will be available to repository rules.
    --incompatible_exclude_starlark_flags_from_exec_config: If true, don't propagate
      starlark flags to the exec transition at default; only propagate starlark flags
      specified in `--experimental_propagate_custom_flag`.
    --allow_analysis_failures: |
      If true, an analysis failure of a rule target results in the target's propagation
      of an instance of `AnalysisFailureInfo` containing the error description, instead
      of resulting in a build failure.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --host_compilation_mode=: |
      Specify the mode the tools used during the build will be built in. Values:
      `fastbuild`, `dbg`, `opt`.
    --verbose_visibility_errors: If enabled, visibility errors include additional
      diagnostic information.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --experimental_exec_configuration_distinguisher=: |
      Please only use this flag as part of a suggested migration or testing strategy due to
      potential for action conflicts. Controls how the execution transition changes the
      `--platform_suffix` flag. In `legacy` mode, sets it to a hash of the execution
      platform. In `fullhash` mode, sets it to a hash of the entire configuration. In `off`
      mode, does not touch it.
    --stamp: Stamp binaries with the date, username, hostname, workspace information,
      etc.
    --noorder_results=: Output the results in dependency-ordered (default) or unordered
      fashion. The unordered output is faster but only supported when --output is
      not minrank, maxrank, or graph.
    --instrumentation_filter=: |
      When coverage is enabled, only rules with names included by the
      specified regex-based filter will be instrumented. Rules prefixed
      with '-' are excluded instead. Note that only non-test rules are
      instrumented unless `--instrument_test_targets` is enabled.
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_extended_sanity_checks: Enables internal validation checks to make
      sure that configured target implementations only access things they should.
      Causes a performance hit.
    --noincompatible_target_cpu_from_platform: |
      If specified, the value of the cpu constraint (`@platforms//cpu:cpu`) of
      the target platform is used to set the `$(TARGET_CPU)` make variable.
    --strict_filesets: If this option is enabled, filesets crossing package boundaries
      are reported as errors.
    --noallow_unresolved_symlinks: |
      If enabled, Bazel allows the use of `ctx.action.declare_symlink()` and the use of
      `ctx.actions.symlink()` without a target file, thus allowing the creation of
      unresolved symlinks.

      Unresolved symlinks inside tree artifacts are not currently supported.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --build_runfile_links: If true, build runfiles symlink forests for all targets.  If
      false, write them only when required by a local action, test or run command.
    --experimental_graphless_query=: If true, uses a Query implementation that does
      not make a copy of the graph. The new implementation only supports --order_output=no,
      as well as only a subset of output formatters.
    --scl_config=: Name of the scl config defined in PROJECT.scl. Note that this feature
      is still under development b/324119879.
    --experimental_allow_map_directory: If enabled, Bazel allows the use of ctx.actions.map_directory().
      This allows for the creation of actions based on the files in a directory through
      a user defined Starlark function and a <code>template_ctx</code> that supports
      basic action generation APIs.
    --noincompatible_filegroup_runfiles_for_data: If true, runfiles of targets listed
      in the srcs attribute are available to targets that consume the filegroup as
      a data dependency.
  description: Executes a dependency graph query.
- {}
- name: run
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --norun: If false, skip running the command line constructed for the built target.
      Note that this flag is ignored for all --script_path builds.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --run_in_cwd: If true, runs the target in the current working directory instead
      of the runfile tree.
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --noomit_run_args: Specifies whether the arguments passed to the runnable target
      will be omitted from the output for privacy reasons. If set to true, the output
      will not contain the arguments passed to the target. If set to false, the output
      will contain the arguments passed to the target.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --noemit_script_path_in_exec_request: If true, emits the ExecRequest with --script_path
      file value and script contents instead of writing the script.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --omit_run_args: Specifies whether the arguments passed to the runnable target
      will be omitted from the output for privacy reasons. If set to true, the output
      will not contain the arguments passed to the target. If set to false, the output
      will contain the arguments passed to the target.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --run: If false, skip running the command line constructed for the built target.
      Note that this flag is ignored for all --script_path builds.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noportable_paths: If true, includes paths to replace in ExecRequest to make
      the resulting paths portable.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --portable_paths: If true, includes paths to replace in ExecRequest to make the
      resulting paths portable.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --script_path=: If set, write a shell script to the given file which invokes the
      target. If this option is set, the target is not run from %{product}. Use '%{product}
      run --script_path=foo //foo && ./foo' to invoke target '//foo' This differs
      from '%{product} run //foo' in that the %{product} lock is released and the
      executable is connected to the terminal's stdin.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --norun_in_cwd: If true, runs the target in the current working directory instead
      of the runfile tree.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --emit_script_path_in_exec_request: If true, emits the ExecRequest with --script_path
      file value and script contents instead of writing the script.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --run_env*=: Specifies the set of environment variables available to the target
      to run. Variables can be either specified by name, in which case the value will
      be taken from the invocation environment, by the <code>name=value</code> pair
      which sets the value independent of the invocation environment, or by <code>=name</code>,
      which unsets the variable of that name. This option can be used multiple times;
      for options given for the same variable, the latest wins, options for different
      variables accumulate. Note that the executed target will generally see the full
      environment of the host except for those variables that have been explicitly
      unset.
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Runs the specified target.
- name: shutdown
  flags: {--iff_heap_size_greater_than=: 'Iff non-zero, then shutdown will only shut
      down the server if the total memory (in MB) consumed by the JVM exceeds this
      value.'}
  description: Stops the %{product} server.
- name: test
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --notest_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the
      actual test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --noverbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --test_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the actual
      test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --verbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --print_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --noprint_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
    --progress_report_interval=: |
      The number of seconds to wait between reports on still running jobs. The
      default value 0 means the first report will be printed after 10
      seconds, then 30 seconds and after that progress is reported once every minute.
      When `--curses` is enabled, progress is reported every second.
  description: Builds and runs the specified test targets.
- name: vendor
  flags:
    --noexecution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to
      compare logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant
      CPU and memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing
      the log in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and
      JSON formats; the compact format is never sorted.
    --incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --noexperimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --experimental_build_event_output_group_mode*=: |
      Specify how an output group's files will be represented in `TargetComplete`/`AspectComplete`
      BEP events. Values are an assignment of an output group name to one of
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`, `INLINE_ONLY`, or `BOTH`. The default value is
      `NAMED_SET_OF_FILES_ONLY`. If an output group is repeated, the final value to
      appear is used. The default value sets the mode for coverage artifacts to BOTH:
      `--experimental_build_event_output_group_mode=baseline.lcov=both`
    --strategy*=: Specify how to distribute compilation of other spawn actions. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". This flag overrides
      the values set by --spawn_strategy (and --genrule_strategy if used with mnemonic
      Genrule). See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html for details.
    --check_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    -j, --jobs=: The number of concurrent jobs to run. Takes an integer, or a keyword
      ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>)
      eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". Values must be between 1 and 5000. Values above
      2500 may cause memory issues. "auto" calculates a reasonable default based on
      host resources.
    --noexperimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the
      analysis and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --test_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire build
      to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --check_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_deadline=: Deadline to use for remote analysis
      cache operations.
    --nomaterialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --test_size_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test sizes. Each size
      can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded sizes. Only those test
      targets will be found that contain at least one included size and do not contain
      any excluded sizes. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the
      test command.
    --rewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --build: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --test_output=: Specifies desired output mode. Valid values are 'summary' to output
      only test status summary, 'errors' to also print test logs for failed tests,
      'all' to print logs for all tests and 'streamed' to output logs for all tests
      in real time (this will force tests to be executed locally one at a time regardless
      of --test_strategy value).
    --noexperimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --test_lang_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test languages. Each
      language can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded languages.
      Only those test targets will be found that are written in the specified languages.
      The name used for each language should be the same as the language prefix in
      the *_test rule, e.g. one of 'cc', 'java', 'py', etc. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --noincompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility: If true, enforce config_setting
      visibility restrictions. If false, every config_setting is visible to every
      target. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12932.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_strategy=: |
      Selects how to upload artifacts referenced in the build event protocol. In Bazel
      the valid options include `local` and `remote`. The default value is `local`.
    --experimental_skyframe_memory_dump=: |
      Dump the memory use of individual nodes in the Skyframe graph after the build. This
      option takes a number of flags separated by commas:
      - `json` (no-op, that's the only format).
      - `notransient` (don't traverse transient fields).
      - `noconfig` (ignore objects related to configurations).
      - `noprecomputed` (ignore precomputed values).
      - `noworkspacestatus` (ignore objects related to the workspace status machinery).
    --enforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --experimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_oom_sensitive_skyfunctions_semaphore_size=: 'Sets the size of the
      semaphore used to prevent SkyFunctions with large peak memory requirement from
      OOM-ing blaze. A value of 0 indicates that no semaphore should be used. Example
      value: `HOST_CPUS*0.5`.'
    --noexperimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --fetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false, the
      command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --nobuild_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --noenforce_project_configs: If true, interactive builds may only pass the --scl_config
      build flag; they may not use any other build flags. --scl_config must be set
      to an officially suported project configuration. Supported configurations are
      defined in the target's PROJECT.scl, which can be found by walking up the target's
      packagge path. See b/324126745.
    --output_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --execution_log_sort: Whether to sort the execution log, making it easier to compare
      logs across invocations. Set to false to avoid potentially significant CPU and
      memory usage at the end of the invocation, at the cost of producing the log
      in nondeterministic execution order. Only applies to the binary and JSON formats;
      the compact format is never sorted.
    --noexperimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_check=: Strategies to handle potential incorrectness
      from changes beyond the frontier (i.e. outside the active directories)
    --nodiscard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --noexperimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the
      BEP when presenting output files.
    --noexperimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    --test_tmpdir=: Specifies the base temporary directory for 'bazel test' to use.
    --nokeep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --nobuild: |
      Execute the build; this is the usual behaviour.
      Specifying `--nobuild` causes the build to stop before executing the build
      actions, returning zero if the package loading and analysis phases completed
      successfully; this mode is useful for testing those phases.
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file=: |
      Specify the output file for the aquery dump after a build. Use in conjunction with
      `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format`. The path provided is relative to
      Bazel's output base, unless it's an absolute path. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --nocheck_tests_up_to_date: Don't run tests, just check if they are up-to-date.  If
      all tests results are up-to-date, the testing completes successfully.  If any
      test needs to be built or executed, an error is reported and the testing fails.  This
      option implies --check_up_to_date behavior.
    --noexperimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Only
      schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --output_filter=: Only shows warnings and action outputs for rules with a name
      matching the provided regular expression.
    --test_strategy=: Specifies which strategy to use when running tests.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_enable_metadata_queries: A flag to switch on/off
      inserting and querying the metadata db (b/425247333).
    --experimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --experimental_async_execution_max_concurrent_actions=: |
      The number of maximum concurrent actions to run with async execution. If the value is
      less than `--jobs`, it is clamped to `--jobs`.
    --nouse_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --strategy_regexp*=: 'Override which spawn strategy should be used to execute
      spawn actions that have descriptions matching a certain regex_filter. See --per_file_copt
      for details onregex_filter matching. The last regex_filter that matches the
      description is used. This option overrides other flags for specifying strategy.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=//foo.*\\.cc,-//foo/bar=local means to run actions
      using local strategy if their descriptions match //foo.*.cc but not //foo/bar.
      Example: --strategy_regexp=''Compiling.*/bar=local  --strategy_regexp=Compiling=sandboxed
      will run ''Compiling //foo/bar/baz'' with the ''local'' strategy, but reversing
      the order would run it with ''sandboxed''. '
    --deleted_packages*=: |-
      A comma-separated list of names of packages which the build system will consider non-existent, even if they are visible somewhere on the package path.
      Use this option when deleting a subpackage 'x/y' of an existing package 'x'.  For example, after deleting x/y/BUILD in your client, the build system may complain if it encounters a label '//x:y/z' if that is still provided by another package_path entry.  Specifying --deleted_packages x/y avoids this problem.
    --noexperimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --experimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to the
      remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --nooutput_tree_tracking: If set, tell the output service (if any) to track when
      files in the output tree have been modified externally (not by the build system).
      This should improve incremental build speed when an appropriate output service
      is enabled.
    --notest_keep_going: When disabled, any non-passing test will cause the entire
      build to stop. By default all tests are run, even if some do not pass.
    --noallow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --explain=: Causes the build system to explain each executed step of the build.
      The explanation is written to the specified log file.
    --execution_log_json_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as newline-delimited
      JSON representations of SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto.
      Prefer --execution_log_compact_file, which is significantly smaller and cheaper
      to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file (compact format; mutually
      exclusive), --execution_log_binary_file (binary protobuf format; mutually exclusive),
      --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log), --subcommands (for
      displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --nofetch: Allows the command to fetch external dependencies. If set to false,
      the command will utilize any cached version of the dependency, and if none exists,
      the command will result in failure.
    --experimental_stats_summary: Enable a modernized summary of the build stats.
    --discard_analysis_cache: Discard the analysis cache immediately after the analysis
      phase completes. Reduces memory usage by ~10%, but makes further incremental
      builds slower.
    --noallow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --compile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files. This
      is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --test_summary=: Specifies the desired format of the test summary. Valid values
      are 'short' to print information only about tests executed, 'terse', to print
      information only about unsuccessful tests that were run, 'detailed' to print
      detailed information about failed test cases, 'testcase' to print summary in
      test case resolution, do not print detailed information about failed test cases
      and 'none' to omit the summary.
    --allowed_local_actions_regex=: A regex whitelist for action types which may be
      run locally. If unset, all actions are allowed to execute locally
    --verbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_skyfocus_dump_keys=: For debugging Skyfocus. Dump the focused SkyKeys
      (roots, leafs, focused deps, focused rdeps).
    --show_result=: |
      Show the results of the build. For each target, state whether or not it was brought
      up-to-date, and if so, a list of output files that were built.  The printed files
      are convenient strings for copy+pasting to the shell, to execute them.

      This option requires an integer argument, which is the threshold number of targets
      above which result information is not printed. Thus zero causes suppression of
      the message and `MAX_INT` causes printing of the result to occur always. The
      default is one.

      If nothing was built for a target its results may be omitted to keep the output
      under the threshold.
    --norun_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --notest_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the
      actual test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --experimental_fsvc_threads=: The number of threads that are used by the `FileSystemValueChecker`.
    --noverbose_failures: If a command fails, print out the full command line.
    --experimental_build_event_expand_filesets: If true, expand Filesets in the BEP
      when presenting output files.
    --experimental_extra_action_filter=: Deprecated in favor of aspects. Filters set
      of targets to schedule extra_actions for.
    --incompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --default_visibility=: Default visibility for packages that don't set it explicitly
      ('public' or 'private').
    --noskip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_format=: |
      Writes the state of Skyframe (which includes previous invocations on this blaze instance
      as well) after a build. Output is streamed remotely unless local output is
      requested with `--experimental_aquery_dump_after_build_output_file`.  Does not
      honor aquery flags for `--include_*`, but uses the same defaults, except for
      `--include_commandline=false`. Possible output formats:
      `proto|streamed_proto|textproto|jsonproto`. Using this will disable Skymeld.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_max_batch_size=: Batch size limit for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --noexperimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --nocompile_one_dependency: Compile a single dependency of the argument files.
      This is useful for syntax checking source files in IDEs, for example, by rebuilding
      a single target that depends on the source file to detect errors as early as
      possible in the edit/build/test cycle. This argument affects the way all non-flag
      arguments are interpreted; instead of being targets to build they are source
      filenames.  For each source filename an arbitrary target that depends on it
      will be built.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_write_proxy=: The address of the SkycacheStorageWriteProxyService.
      If set, this service will be used for uploading analysis cache data.
    --noexperimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache=: The URL for the remote analysis caching
      backend.
    --noverbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --symlink_prefix=: |
      The prefix that is prepended to any of the convenience symlinks that are created
      after a build. If omitted, the default value is the name of the build tool
      followed by a hyphen. If `/` is passed, then no symlinks are created and no
      warning is emitted. Warning: the special functionality for `/` will be deprecated
      soon; use `--experimental_convenience_symlinks=ignore` instead.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_service=: Locator for the AnalysisCacheService instance.
    --max_test_output_bytes=: Specifies maximum per-test-log size that can be emitted
      when --test_output is 'errors' or 'all'. Useful for avoiding overwhelming the
      output with excessively noisy test output. The test header is included in the
      log size. Negative values imply no limit. Output is all or nothing.
    --noanalyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_mode=: The transport direction for the remote
      analysis cache.
    --genrule_strategy=: Specify how to execute genrules. This flag will be phased
      out. Instead, use --spawn_strategy=<value> to control all actions or --strategy=Genrule=<value>
      to control genrules only.
    --allow_one_action_on_resource_unavailable: If set, allow at least one action
      to run even if the resource is not enough or unavailable.
    --test_verbose_timeout_warnings: If true, print additional warnings when the actual
      test execution time does not match the timeout defined by the test (whether
      implied or explicit).
    --experimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform*=: |
      Filters spawn strategies by the execution platform without affecting order.
      For example:
      ```
      common --spawn_strategy=remote,sandboxed,worker,local
      common --strategy=Genrule=local
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=@platforms//host:host=local,sandboxed,worker
      common --allowed_strategies_by_exec_platform=//:linux_amd64=remote
      ```
      With the above options;
      - Actions configured for the host platform will be given `remote,sandboxed,worker`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform will be given `remote`.
      - Actions configured for the `//:linux_amd64` platform with mnemonic `Genrule` will be
        given no strategies and fail to spawn.
    --materialize_param_files: Writes intermediate parameter files to output tree
      even when using remote action execution or caching. Useful when debugging actions.
      This is implied by --subcommands and --verbose_failures.
    --noexperimental_frontier_violation_verbose: If true, Bazel will print instructions
      for fixing Skycache violations
    --experimental_active_directories=: Active directories for Skyfocus and remote
      analysis caching. Specify as comma-separated workspace root-relative paths.
      This is a stateful flag. Defining one persists it for subsequent invocations,
      until it is redefined with a new set.
    --experimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --experimental_lazy_macro_expansion_packages=: List of packages in which symbolic
      macro are expanded only if necessary.
    --test_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test tags. Each tag can
      be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those test targets
      will be found that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any
      excluded tags. This option affects --build_tests_only behavior and the test
      command.
    --output_groups*=: |
      A list of comma-separated output group names, each of which optionally prefixed by a `+`
      or a `-`. A group prefixed by `+` is added to the default set of output groups,
      while a group prefixed by `-` is removed from the default set. If at least one
      group is not prefixed, the default set of output groups is omitted. For example,
      `--output_groups=+foo,+bar` builds the union of the default set, foo, and bar,
      while `--output_groups=foo,bar` overrides the default set such that only foo and
      bar are built.
    --experimental_enable_critical_path_profiling: If set (the default), critical
      path profiling is enabled for the execution phase. This has a slight overhead
      in RAM and CPU, and may prevent Bazel from making certain aggressive RAM optimizations
      in some cases.
    --experimental_build_event_upload_retry_minimum_delay=: 'Initial, minimum delay
      for exponential backoff retries when BEP upload fails. (exponent: 1.6)'
    --incompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_local_lockfree_output: When true, the local spawn runner doesn't
      lock the output tree during dynamic execution. Instead, spawns are allowed to
      execute until they are explicitly interrupted by a faster remote action.
    --verbose_test_summary: If true, print additional information (timing, number
      of failed runs, etc) in the test summary.
    --show_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noincompatible_config_setting_private_default_visibility: If incompatible_enforce_config_setting_visibility=false,
      this is a noop. Else, if this flag is false, any config_setting without an explicit
      visibility attribute is //visibility:public. If this flag is true, config_setting
      follows the same visibility logic as all other rules. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/12933.
    --print_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --version_window_for_dirty_node_gc=: Nodes that have been dirty for more than
      this many versions will be deleted from the graph upon the next update. Values
      must be non-negative long integers, or -1 indicating the maximum possible window.
    --nobuild_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --experimental_remote_analysis_unreachable_cache_retry_interval=: How long to
      wait before retrying a cache get request that failed due to an UNREACHABLE channel.
      This is a workaround for the client library reporting 'ready' prematurely.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution scheduling
      based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental scheduling
      have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful machines
      with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_async_execution: |
      If set to true, Bazel is allowed to run action in a virtual thread. The number of
      actions in flight is still capped with `--jobs`.
    --run_validations: |
      Whether to run validation actions as part of the build. See [Validation Actions].

      [Validation Actions]: https://bazel.build/extending/rules#validation_actions
    --nocheck_up_to_date: Don't perform the build, just check if it is up-to-date.  If
      all targets are up-to-date, the build completes successfully.  If any step needs
      to be executed an error is reported and the build fails.
    --legacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_bep_target_summary: Whether to publish `TargetSummary` events.
    --build_tests_only: If specified, only *_test and test_suite rules will be built
      and other targets specified on the command line will be ignored. By default
      everything that was requested will be built.
    --allow_analysis_cache_discard: |
      If discarding the analysis cache due to a change in the build system, setting this
      option to false will cause bazel to exit, rather than continuing with the build.
      This option has no effect when `--discard_analysis_cache` is also set.
    --noshow_loading_progress: If enabled, causes Bazel to print "Loading package:"
      messages.
    --noexperimental_cpu_load_scheduling: Enables the experimental local execution
      scheduling based on CPU load, not estimation of actions one by one.  Experimental
      scheduling have showed the large benefit on a large local builds on a powerful
      machines with the large number of cores. Reccommended to use with --local_resources=cpu=HOST_CPUS
    --experimental_analysis_cache_key_distinguisher_for_testing=: An opaque string
      used as part of the cache key. Should only be used for testing.
    --aspects_parameters*=: |
      Specifies the values of the command-line aspects parameters. Each parameter value is
      specified via `<param_name>=<param_value>`, for example `my_param=my_val` where
      `my_param` is a parameter of some aspect in `--aspects` list or required by an
      aspect in the list. This option can be used multiple times. However, it is not
      allowed to assign values to the same parameter more than once.
    --noexperimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --noexperimental_stream_log_file_uploads: Stream log file uploads directly to
      the remote storage rather than writing them to disk.
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks=: |
      This flag controls how the convenience symlinks (the symlinks that appear in the
      workspace after the build) will be managed. Possible values:
      - `normal` (default): Each kind of convenience symlink will be created or deleted,
        as determined by the build.
      - `clean`: All symlinks will be unconditionally deleted.
      - `ignore`: Symlinks will not be created or cleaned up.
      - `log_only`: Generate log messages as if `normal` were passed, but don't actually
        perform any filesystem operations (useful for tools).

      Note that only symlinks whose names are generated by the current value of
      `--symlink_prefix` can be affected; if the prefix changes, any pre-existing
      symlinks will be left alone.
    --experimental_remote_cache_eviction_retries=: The maximum number of attempts
      to retry if the build encountered a transient remote cache error that would
      otherwise fail the build. Applies for example when artifacts are evicted from
      the remote cache, or in certain cache failure conditions. A new invocation id
      will be generated for each attempt.
    --noexperimental_skyframe_error_handling_refactor: 'Used solely for the safe rollout
      of simplifying Skyframe error handling. This will beremoved once the rollout
      is complete (expected timeframe: 1 release)'
    --noprint_relative_test_log_paths: If true, when printing the path to a test log,
      use relative path that makes use of the 'testlogs' convenience symlink. N.B.
      - A subsequent 'build'/'test'/etc invocation with a different configuration
      can cause the target of this symlink to change, making the path printed previously
      no longer useful.
    --execution_log_compact_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      ExecLogEntry protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. The entire
      file is zstd compressed. Related flags: --execution_log_binary_file (binary
      protobuf format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --test_timeout_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of test timeouts. Each
      timeout can be optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded timeouts. Only
      those test targets will be found that contain at least one included timeout
      and do not contain any excluded timeouts. This option affects --build_tests_only
      behavior and the test command.
    --experimental_max_directories_to_eagerly_visit_in_globbing=: If non-negative,
      the first time a glob is evaluated in a package, the subdirectories of the package
      will be traversed in order to warm filesystem caches and compensate for lack
      of parallelism in globbing. At most this many directories will be visited.
    --max_config_changes_to_show=: When discarding the analysis cache due to a change
      in the build options, displays up to the given number of changed option names.
      If the number given is -1, all changed options will be displayed.
    --noexperimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --experimental_skyframe_cpu_heavy_skykeys_thread_pool_size=: 'If set to a positive
      value (e.g. `HOST_CPUS*1.5`), Skyframe will run the loading/analysis phase with
      2 separate thread pools: 1 with `<value>` threads (ideally close to `HOST_CPUS`)
      reserved for CPU-heavy SkyKeys, and 1 "standard" thread pool (whose size is
      controlled by `--loading_phase_threads`) for the rest.'
    --noexperimental_skyfocus_dump_post_gc_stats: For debugging Skyfocus. If enabled,
      trigger manual GC before/after focusing to report heap sizes reductions. This
      will increase the Skyfocus latency.
    --flaky_test_attempts*=: 'Each test will be retried up to the specified number
      of times in case of any test failure. Tests that required more than one attempt
      to pass are marked as ''FLAKY'' in the test summary. Normally the value specified
      is just an integer or the string ''default''. If an integer, then all tests
      will be run up to N times. If ''default'', then only a single test attempt will
      be made for regular tests and three for tests marked explicitly as flaky by
      their rule (flaky=1 attribute). Alternate syntax: regex_filter@flaky_test_attempts.
      Where flaky_test_attempts is as above and regex_filter stands for a list of
      include and exclude regular expression patterns (Also see --runs_per_test).
      Example: --flaky_test_attempts=//foo/.*,-//foo/bar/.*@3 deflakes all tests in
      //foo/ except those under foo/bar three times. This option can be passed multiple
      times. The most recently passed argument that matches takes precedence. If nothing
      matches, behavior is as if ''default'' above.'
    --experimental_skymeld_analysis_overlap_percentage=: The value represents the
      % of the analysis phase which will be overlapped with the execution phase. A
      value of x means Skyframe will queue up execution tasks and wait until there's
      x% of the top level target left to be analyzed before allowing them to launch.
      When the value is 0%, we'd wait for all analysis to finish before executing
      (no overlap). When it's 100%, the phases are free to overlap as much as they
      can.
    --experimental_use_validation_aspect: Whether to run validation actions using
      aspect (for parallelism with tests).
    -k, --keep_going: Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target
      that failed and those that depend on it cannot be analyzed, other prerequisites
      of these targets can be.
    --experimental_analysis_cache_server_checksum_override=: 'If set, Blaze will use
      this checksum to look up entries in the remote analysis cache and not its own.
      WARNING: this might result in incorrect behavior. Only for debugging. It''s
      best if the difference between the writer and the reader is only additional
      logging. In particular, the data structures that are being serialized  and the
      observable behavior of the serialization machinery must not change.'
    --cache_computed_file_digests=: If greater than 0, configures Bazel to cache file
      digests in memory based on their metadata instead of recomputing the digests
      from disk every time they are needed. Setting this to 0 ensures correctness
      because not all file changes can be noted from file metadata. When not 0, the
      number indicates the size of the cache as the number of file digests to be cached.
    --noexperimental_run_bep_event_include_residue: Whether to include the command-line
      residue in run build events which could contain the residue. By default, the
      residue is not included in run command build events that could contain the residue.
    --analyze: |
      Execute the loading/analysis phase; this is the usual behaviour. Specifying `--noanalyze`
      causes the build to stop before starting the loading/analysis phase, just doing
      target pattern parsing and returning zero if that completed successfully; this
      mode is useful for testing.
    --repo*=: |
      Only vendors the specified repository, which can be either `@apparent_repo_name` or
      `@@canonical_repo_name`. This option can be set multiple times.
    --experimental_remote_analysis_cache_concurrency=: Target concurrency for remote
      analysis caching RPCs.
    --local_termination_grace_seconds=: Time to wait between terminating a local process
      due to timeout and forcefully shutting it down.
    --hide_aspect_results=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspect names to not display in results (see `--show_result`).
      Useful for keeping aspects added by wrappers which are typically not interesting
      to end users out of console output.
    --target_pattern_file=: If set, build will read patterns from the file named here,
      rather than on the command line. It is an error to specify a file here as well
      as command-line patterns.
    --skip_incompatible_explicit_targets: |
      Skip incompatible targets that are explicitly listed on the command line.
      By default, building such targets results in an error but they are
      silently skipped when this option is enabled. See: [Skipping incompatible targets]

      [Skipping incompatible targets]: https://bazel.build/extending/platforms#skipping-incompatible-targets
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event: |
      This flag controls whether or not we will post the build event
      `ConvenienceSymlinksIdentified` to the Build Event Protocol. If the value is true,
      the BEP will have an entry for `convenienceSymlinksIdentified`,
      listing all of the convenience symlinks created in your workspace. If false, then
      the `convenienceSymlinksIdentified` entry in the BEP will be empty.
    --noexpand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --experimental_materialize_param_files_directly: If materializing param files,
      do so with direct writes to disk.
    --noexperimental_extra_action_top_level_only: Deprecated in favor of aspects.
      Only schedules extra_actions for top level targets.
    --nolegacy_important_outputs: |
      Use this to suppress generation of the legacy `important_outputs` field in the
      `TargetComplete` event. `important_outputs` are required for Bazel to ResultStore/BTX
      integration.
    --experimental_check_output_files: Check for modifications made to the output
      files of a build. Consider setting this flag to false if you don't expect these
      files to change outside of bazel since it will speed up subsequent runs as they
      won't have to check a previous run's cache.
    --use_action_cache: Whether to use the action cache
    --noexperimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --directory_creation_cache=: Describes the cache used to store known regular directories
      as they're created. Parent directories of output files are created on-demand
      during action execution.
    --experimental_local_retries_on_crash=: Number of times to retry a local action
      when we detect that it crashed. This exists to workaround a bug in OSXFUSE which
      is tickled by the use of the dynamic scheduler and --experimental_local_lockfree_output
      due to constant process churn. The bug can be triggered by a cancelled process
      that ran *before* the process we are trying to run, introducing corruption in
      its file reads.
    --build_event_upload_max_retries=: The maximum number of times Bazel should retry
      uploading a build event.
    --serialized_frontier_profile=: Dump a profile of serialized frontier bytes. Specifies
      the output path.
    --build_tag_filters=: Specifies a comma-separated list of tags. Each tag can be
      optionally preceded with '-' to specify excluded tags. Only those targets will
      be built that contain at least one included tag and do not contain any excluded
      tags. This option does not affect the set of tests executed with the 'test'
      command; those are be governed by the test filtering options, for example '--test_tag_filters'
    --aspects*=: |
      Comma-separated list of aspects to be applied to top-level targets. In the list, if
      aspect `some_aspect` specifies required aspect providers via
      `required_aspect_providers`, `some_aspect` will run after
      every aspect that was mentioned before it in the aspects list whose advertised
      providers satisfy `some_aspect` required aspect providers. Moreover,
      `some_aspect` will run after all its required aspects specified by
      `requires` attribute.
      `some_aspect` will then have access to the values of those aspects'
      providers.
      `{bzl-file-label}%{aspect_name}`, for example `//tools:my_def.bzl%my_aspect`, where
      `my_aspect` is a top-level value from a file `tools/my_def.bzl`.
    --local_test_jobs=: The max number of local test jobs to run concurrently. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". 0 means local resources
      will limit the number of local test jobs to run concurrently instead. Setting
      this greater than the value for --jobs is ineffectual.
    --noexperimental_check_external_other_files: Check for modifications made to the
      non-output, non-repo external files, e.g. host files.
    --experimental_merged_skyframe_analysis_execution: If this flag is set, the analysis
      and execution phases of Skyframe are merged.
    --expand_test_suites: 'Expand test_suite targets into their constituent tests
      before analysis. When this flag is turned on (the default), negative target
      patterns will apply to the tests belonging to the test suite, otherwise they
      will not. Turning off this flag is useful when top-level aspects are applied
      at command line: then they can analyze test_suite targets.'
    --noexperimental_process_wrapper_graceful_sigterm: When true, make the process-wrapper
      propagate SIGTERMs (used by the dynamic scheduler to stop process trees) to
      the subprocesses themselves, giving them the grace period in --local_termination_grace_seconds
      before forcibly sending a SIGKILL.
    --local_resources*=: 'Set the number of resources available to Bazel. Takes in
      an assignment to a float or HOST_RAM/HOST_CPUS, optionally followed by [-|*]<float>
      (eg. memory=HOST_RAM*.5 to use half the available RAM). Can be used multiple
      times to specify multiple types of resources. Bazel will limit concurrently
      running actions based on the available resources and the resources required.
      Tests can declare the amount of resources they need by using a tag of the "resources:<resource
      name>:<amount>" format. '
    --legacy_globbing_threads=: Number of threads to use for glob evaluation. Takes
      an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally followed
      by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" means to use
      a reasonable value derived from the machine's hardware profile (e.g. the number
      of processors).
    --experimental_skyframe_target_pattern_evaluator: Use the Skyframe-based target
      pattern evaluator; implies --experimental_interleave_loading_and_analysis.
    --execution_log_binary_file=: 'Log the executed spawns into this file as length-delimited
      SpawnExec protos, according to src/main/protobuf/spawn.proto. Prefer --execution_log_compact_file,
      which is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce. Related flags: --execution_log_compact_file
      (compact format; mutually exclusive), --execution_log_json_file (text JSON format;
      mutually exclusive), --execution_log_sort (whether to sort the execution log),
      --subcommands (for displaying subcommands in terminal output).'
    --remote_analysis_json_log=: If set, a JSON file is written to this location that
      contains a detailed log of the behavior of remote analysis caching. It's interpreted
      as a path relative to the current working directory.
    --noincompatible_skip_genfiles_symlink: |
      If set to true, the genfiles symlink will not be created. For more information, see
      [GH-8651].

      [GH-8651]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8651
    --experimental_enable_skyfocus: If true, enable the use of --experimental_active_directories
      to reduce Bazel's memory footprint for incremental builds. This feature is known
      as Skyfocus.
    --build_manual_tests: Forces test targets tagged 'manual' to be built. 'manual'
      tests are excluded from processing. This option forces them to be built (but
      not executed).
    --loading_phase_threads=: Number of parallel threads to use for the loading/analysis
      phase.Takes an integer, or a keyword ("auto", "HOST_CPUS", "HOST_RAM"), optionally
      followed by an operation ([-|*]<float>) eg. "auto", "HOST_CPUS*.5". "auto" sets
      a reasonable default based on host resources. Must be at least 1.
    --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling_window_size=: The size of window during experimental
      scheduling of action based on CPU load. Make sense to define only when flag
      --experimental_cpu_load_scheduling is enabled.
    --norewind_lost_inputs: Whether to use action rewinding to recover from lost inputs.
    --spawn_strategy=: Specify how spawn actions are executed by default. Accepts
      a comma-separated list of strategies from highest to lowest priority. For each
      action Bazel picks the strategy with the highest priority that can execute the
      action. The default value is "remote,worker,sandboxed,local". See https://blog.bazel.build/2019/06/19/list-strategy.html
      for details.
    --package_path=: A colon-separated list of where to look for packages. Elements
      beginning with '%workspace%' are relative to the enclosing workspace. If omitted
      or empty, the default is the output of 'bazel info default-package-path'.
    -s, --subcommands=: 'Display the subcommands executed during a build. Related
      flags: --execution_log_json_file, --execution_log_binary_file (for logging subcommands
      to a file in a tool-friendly format).'
