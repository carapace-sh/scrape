    at-operation: |-
      Operation to load the repo at

      Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

      You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

      Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

      When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

      It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

    help: Print help (see a summary with '-h')
    ignore-immutable: |-
      Allow rewriting immutable commits

      By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits. This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.

      This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or the `immutable` template keyword.
    ignore-working-copy: |-
      Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it

      By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

      Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.
    quiet: |-
      Silence non-primary command output

      Abandon a revision

      Abandon a revision, rebasing descendants onto its parent(s). The behavior is similar to `jj restore --changes-in`; the difference is that `jj abandon` gives you a new change, while `jj restore` updates the existing change.

      If a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

        Run a given command to find the first bad revision.

        Uses binary search to find the first bad revision. Revisions are evaluated by running a given command (see the documentation for `--command` for details).

        It is assumed that if a given revision is bad, then all its descendants in the input range are also bad.

        The target of the bisection can be inverted to look for the first good revision by passing `--find-good`.

        Hint: You can pass your shell as evaluation command. You can then run manual tests in the shell and make sure to exit the shell with appropriate error code depending on the outcome (e.g. `exit 0` to mark the revision as good in Bash or Fish).

        Example: To run `cargo test` with the changes from revision `xyz` applied:

        `jj bisect --range v1.0..main -- bash -c "jj duplicate -r xyz -B @ && cargo test"`

        Delete an existing bookmark and propagate the deletion to remotes on the next push

        Revisions referred to by the deleted bookmarks are not abandoned. To delete revisions as well as bookmarks, use `jj abandon`. For example, `jj abandon main..<bookmark>` will abandon revisions belonging to the `<bookmark>` branch (relative to the `main` branch.)

        If you don't want the deletion of the local bookmark to propagate to any tracked remote bookmarks, use `jj bookmark forget` instead.

          Operation to load the repo at

          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

          Operation to load the repo at

          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

          By default, Jujutsu searches for the closest .jj/ directory in an ancestor of the current working directory.

          Render each variable using the given template

          The following keywords are available in the template expression:

          * `name: String`: Config name.
          * `value: ConfigValue`: Value to be formatted in TOML syntax.
          * `overridden: Boolean`: True if the value is shadowed by other.
          * `source: String`: Source of the value.
          * `path: String`: Path to the config file.

          Can be overridden by the `templates.config_list` setting. To
          see a detailed config list, use the `builtin_config_list_detailed`
          template.

          Operation to load the repo at

          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

        You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

        Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

        When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

        It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

      ignore-immutable: |-
        Allow rewriting immutable commits

        By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits. This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.

        This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or the `immutable` template keyword.
      ignore-working-copy: |-
        Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it

        By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

        Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.

        By default, Jujutsu searches for the closest .jj/ directory in an ancestor of the current working directory.

        Preserve the content (not the diff) when rebasing descendants

        When rebasing a descendant on top of the rewritten revision, its diff compared to its parent(s) is normally preserved, i.e. the same way that descendants are always rebased. This flag makes it so the content/state is preserved instead of preserving the diff.

      When none of the `--onto`, `--insert-after`, or `--insert-before` arguments are provided, commits will be duplicated onto their existing parents or onto other newly duplicated commits.

      When any of the `--onto`, `--insert-after`, or `--insert-before` arguments are provided, the roots of the specified commits will be duplicated onto the destination indicated by the arguments.

  documentation:
    command: |-
      Update files with formatting fixes or other changes

      The primary use case for this command is to apply the results of automatic
      code formatting tools to revisions that may not be properly formatted yet.
      It can also be used to modify files with other tools like `sed` or `sort`.

      ### How it works

      The changed files in the given revisions will be updated with any fixes
      determined by passing their file content through any external tools the user
      has configured for those files. Descendants will also be updated by passing
      their versions of the same files through the same tools, which will ensure
      that the fixes are not lost. This will never result in new conflicts. Files
      with existing conflicts will be updated on all sides of the conflict, which
      can potentially increase or decrease the number of conflict markers.

      ### Configuration

      See `jj help -k config` chapter `Code formatting and other file content
      transformations` to understand how to configure your tools.

      ### Execution Example

      Let's consider the following configuration is set. We have two code
      formatters (`clang-format` and `black`), which apply to three different
      file extensions (`.cc`, `.h`, and `.py`):

      ```toml
      [fix.tools.clang-format]
      command = ["/usr/bin/clang-format", "--assume-filename=$path"]
      patterns = ["glob:'**/*.cc'",
                  "glob:'**/*.h'"]

      [fix.tools.black]
      command = ["/usr/bin/black", "-", "--stdin-filename=$path"]
      patterns = ["glob:'**/*.py'"]
      ```

      Now, let's see what would happen to the following history, when executing
      `jj fix`.

      ```text
      C (mutable)
      |  Modifies file: foo.py
      |
      B @ (working copy - mutable)
      |  Modifies file: README.md
      |
      A (mutable)
      |  Modifies files: src/bar.cc and src/bar.h
      |
      X (immutable)
      ```

      By default, `jj fix` will modify revisions that matches the revset
      `reachable(@, mutable())` (see `jj help -k revsets`) which corresponds to
      the revisions `A`, `B` and `C` here.

      The following operations will then happen:

      - For revision `A`, content from this revision for files `src/bar.cc` and
        `src/bar.h` will each be provided to `clang-format` and the result output
        will be used to recreate revision `A` which we will call `A'`. All other
        files are untouched.
      - For revision `B`, same thing happen for files `src/bar.cc` and `src/bar.h`
        Their content from revision `B` will go through `clang-format`. The file
        `README.md` as any other files, are untouched as no pattern matches it. We
        obtain revision `B'`.
      - For revision `C`, `src/bar.cc` and `src/bar.h` goes through `clang-format`
        and file `foo.py` is fixed using `black`. Any other file is untouched. We
        obtain revision `C'`.

      ```text
      C (mutable)                    /-> C'
      |  src/bar.cc -> clang-format -|   |
      |  src/bar.h --> clang-format -|   |
      |  foo.py -----> black --------|   |
      |  * --------------------------/   |
      |                                  |
      B @ (working copy - mutable)   /-> B' @
      |  src/bar.cc -> clang-format -|   |
      |  src/bar.h --> clang-format -|   |
      |  * --------------------------|   |
      |                                  |
      A (mutable)                    /-> A'
      |  src/bar.cc -> clang-format -|   |
      |  src/bar.h --> clang-format -|   |
      |  * --------------------------/   |
      |                                  |
      X (immutable)                      X
      ```

      The revisions are now all correctly formatted according to the
      configuration.

        You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

        Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

        When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

        It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

        Upload changes to Gerrit for code review, or update existing changes.

        Uploading in a set of revisions to Gerrit creates a single "change" for each revision included in the revset. These changes are then available for review on your Gerrit instance.

        Note: The gerrit commit Id may not match that of your local commit Id, since we add a `Change-Id` footer to the commit message if one does not already exist. This ID is based off the jj Change-Id, but is not the same.

        If a change already exists for a given revision (i.e. it contains the same `Change-Id`), this command will update the contents of the existing change to match.

        Note: this command takes 1-or-more revsets arguments, each of which can resolve to multiple revisions; so you may post trees or ranges of commits to Gerrit for review all at once.

          Convert into a colocated Jujutsu/Git repository

          This moves the underlying Git repository that is found inside the .jj directory to the root of the Jujutsu workspace. This allows you to use Git commands directly in the Jujutsu workspace.
        flag:
          at-operation: |-
            Operation to load the repo at

            Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

            You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

            Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

            When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

            It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

      command: |-
        Push to a Git remote

        By default, pushes tracking bookmarks pointing to `remote_bookmarks(remote=<remote>)..@`. Use `--bookmark` to push specific bookmarks. Use `--all` to push all bookmarks. Use `--change` to generate bookmark names based on the change IDs of specific commits.

        Unlike in Git, the remote to push to is not derived from the tracked remote bookmarks. Use `--remote` to select the remote Git repository by name. There is no option to push to multiple remotes.

        Before the command actually moves, creates, or deletes a remote bookmark, it makes several [safety checks]. If there is a problem, you may need to run `jj git fetch --remote <remote name>` and/or resolve some [bookmark conflicts].

        [safety checks]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/bookmarks/#pushing-bookmarks-safety-checks

        [bookmark conflicts]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/bookmarks/#conflicts
      flag:
        allow-new: |-
          Allow pushing new bookmarks

          Newly-created remote bookmarks will be tracked automatically.
        allow-private: |-
          Allow pushing commits that are private

          The set of private commits can be configured by the `git.private-commits` setting. The default is `none()`, meaning all commits are eligible to be pushed.
        at-operation: |-
          Operation to load the repo at

          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.
        bookmark: |-
          Push only this bookmark, or bookmarks matching a pattern (can be repeated)

          By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

          [wildcard pattern]: https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/revsets#string-patterns
        change: |-
          Push this commit by creating a bookmark (can be repeated)

          The created bookmark will be tracked automatically. Use the `templates.git_push_bookmark` setting to customize the generated bookmark name. The default is `"push-" ++ change_id.short()`.
        config: |-
          Additional configuration options (can be repeated)

          The name should be specified as TOML dotted keys. The value should be specified as a TOML expression. If string value isn't enclosed by any TOML constructs (such as array notation), quotes can be omitted.
        deleted: |-
          Push all deleted bookmarks

          Only tracked bookmarks can be successfully deleted on the remote. A warning will be printed if any untracked bookmarks on the remote correspond to missing local bookmarks.
        help: Print help (see a summary with '-h')
        ignore-immutable: |-
          Allow rewriting immutable commits

          By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits. This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.

          This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or the `immutable` template keyword.
        ignore-working-copy: |-
          Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it

          By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

          Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.
        named: |-
          Specify a new bookmark name and a revision to push under that name, e.g. '--named myfeature=@'

          Automatically tracks the bookmark if it is new.
        quiet: |-
          Silence non-primary command output

          For example, `jj file list` will still list files, but it won't tell you if the working copy was snapshotted or if descendants were rebased.

          Warnings and errors will still be printed.
        remote: |-
          The remote to push to (only named remotes are supported)

          This defaults to the `git.push` setting. If that is not configured, and if there are multiple remotes, the remote named "origin" will be used.
        repository: |-
          Path to repository to operate on

          By default, Jujutsu searches for the closest .jj/ directory in an ancestor of the current working directory.
        tracked: |-
          Push all tracked bookmarks

          This usually means that the bookmark was already pushed to or fetched from the [relevant remote].

      Create a new, empty change and (by default) edit it in the working copy

      By default, `jj` will edit the new change, making the [working copy] represent the new commit. This can be avoided with `--no-edit`.

      Note that you can create a merge commit by specifying multiple revisions as argument. For example, `jj new @ main` will create a new commit with the working copy and the `main` bookmark as parents.

        Operation to load the repo at

        Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

        You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

        Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

        When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

        It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

      ignore-immutable: |-
        Allow rewriting immutable commits

        By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits. This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.

        This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or the `immutable` template keyword.
      ignore-working-copy: |-
        Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it

        By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

        Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.
      insert-after: |-
        Insert the new change after the given commit(s)

        Example: `jj new --insert-after A` creates a new change between `A` and
        its children:

        ```text
                        B   C
                         \ /
            B   C   =>    @
             \ /          |
              A           A
        ```

        Specifying `--insert-after` multiple times will relocate all children of
        the given commits.

        Example: `jj new --insert-after A --insert-after X` creates a change
        with `A` and `X` as parents, and rebases all children on top of the new
        change:

        ```text
                        B   Y
                         \ /
            B  Y    =>    @
            |  |         / \
            A  X        A   X
        ```
      insert-before: |-
        Insert the new change before the given commit(s)

        Example: `jj new --insert-before C` creates a new change between `C` and
        its parents:

        ```text
                           C
                           |
              C     =>     @
             / \          / \
            A   B        A   B
        ```

        `--insert-after` and `--insert-before` can be combined.

        Example: `jj new --insert-after A --insert-before D`:

        ```text

            D            D
            |           / \
            C          |   C
            |    =>    @   |
            B          |   B
            |           \ /
            A            A
        ```

        Similar to `--insert-after`, you can specify `--insert-before` multiple
        times.

      For example, when the offset is 1:

          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

      1            \ /
      |             0
      0
      ```

      The command effectively says "these revisions are actually independent",
      meaning that they should no longer be ancestors/descendants of each other.
      However, revisions outside the set that were previously ancestors of a
      revision in the set will remain ancestors of it. For example, revision 0
      above remains an ancestor of both 1 and 2. Similarly,
      revisions outside the set that were previously descendants of a revision
      in the set will remain descendants of it. For example, revision 3 above
      remains a descendant of both 1 and 2.

      Therefore, `jj parallelize '1 | 3'` is a no-op. That's because 2, which is
      not in the target set, was a descendant of 1 before, so it remains a
      descendant, and it was an ancestor of 3 before, so it remains an ancestor.

        Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

        You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

        Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

        When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

        It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

    command: |-
      Move revisions to different parent(s)

      This command moves revisions to different parent(s) while preserving the
      changes (diff) in the revisions.

      There are three different ways of specifying which revisions to rebase:

      * `--source/-s` to rebase a revision and its descendants
      * `--branch/-b` to rebase a whole branch, relative to the destination
      * `--revisions/-r` to rebase the specified revisions without their
        descendants

      If no option is specified, it defaults to `-b @`.

      There are three different ways of specifying where the revisions should be
      rebased to:

      * `--onto/-o` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets
      * `--insert-after/-A` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets and
        to rebase the targets' descendants onto the rebased revisions
      * `--insert-before/-B` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets'
        parents and to rebase the targets and their descendants onto the rebased
        revisions

      See the sections below for details about the different ways of specifying
      which revisions to rebase where.

      If a working-copy revision gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty
      revision. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

      ### Specifying which revisions to rebase

      With `--source/-s`, the command rebases the specified revision and its
      descendants to the destination. For example, `jj rebase -s M -o O` would
      transform your history like this (letters followed by an apostrophe are
      post-rebase versions):

      ```text
      O           N'
      |           |
      | N         M'
      | |         |
      | M         O
      | |    =>   |
      | | L       | L
      | |/        | |
      | K         | K
      |/          |/
      J           J
      ```

      Each revision passed to `-s` will become a direct child of the destination,
      so if you instead run `jj rebase -s M -s N -o O` (or `jj rebase -s 'M|N' -o
      O`) in the example above, then N' would instead be a direct child of O.

      With `--branch/-b`, the command rebases the whole "branch" containing the
      specified revision. A "branch" is the set of revisions that includes:

      * the specified revision and ancestors that are not also ancestors of the
        destination
      * all descendants of those revisions

      In other words, `jj rebase -b X -o Y` rebases revisions in the revset
      `(Y..X)::` (which is equivalent to `jj rebase -s 'roots(Y..X)' -o Y` for a
      single root). For example, either `jj rebase -b L -o O` or `jj rebase -b M
      -o O` would transform your history like this (because `L` and `M` are on the
      same "branch", relative to the destination):

      ```text
      O           N'
      |           |
      | N         M'
      | |         |
      | M         | L'
      | |    =>   |/
      | | L       K'
      | |/        |
      | K         O
      |/          |
      J           J
      ```

      With `--revisions/-r`, the command rebases only the specified revisions to
      the destination. Any "hole" left behind will be filled by rebasing
      descendants onto the specified revisions' parent(s). For example,
      `jj rebase -r K -o M` would transform your history like this:

      ```text
      M          K'
      |          |
      | L        M
      | |   =>   |
      | K        | L'
      |/         |/
      J          J
      ```

      Multiple revisions can be specified, and any dependencies (graph edges)
      within the set will be preserved. For example, `jj rebase -r 'K|N' -o O`
      would transform your history like this:

      ```text
      O           N'
      |           |
      | N         K'
      | |         |
      | M         O
      | |    =>   |
      | | L       | M'
      | |/        |/
      | K         | L'
      |/          |/
      J           J
      ```

      `jj rebase -s X` is similar to `jj rebase -r X::` and will behave the same
      if X is a single revision. However, if X is a set of multiple revisions,
      or if you passed multiple `-s` arguments, then `jj rebase -s` will make each
      of the specified revisions an immediate child of the destination, while
      `jj rebase -r` will preserve dependencies within the set.

      Note that you can create a merge revision by repeating the `-o` argument.
      For example, if you realize that revision L actually depends on revision M
      in order to work (in addition to its current parent K), you can run `jj
      rebase -s L -o K -o M`:

      ```text
      M          L'
      |          |\
      | L        M |
      | |   =>   | |
      | K        | K
      |/         |/
      J          J
      ```

      ### Specifying where to rebase the revisions

      With `--onto/-o`, the command rebases the selected revisions onto the
      targets. Existing descendants of the targets will not be affected. See
      the section above for examples.

      With `--insert-after/-A`, the selected revisions will be inserted after the
      targets. This is similar to `-o`, but if the targets have any existing
      descendants, then those will be rebased onto the rebased selected revisions.

      For example, `jj rebase -r K -A L` will rewrite history like this:
      ```text
      N           N'
      |           |
      | M         | M'
      |/          |/
      L      =>   K'
      |           |
      | K         L
      |/          |
      J           J
      ```

      The `-A` (and `-B`) argument can also be used for reordering revisions. For
      example, `jj rebase -r M -A J` will rewrite history like this:
      ```text
      M          L'
      |          |
      L          K'
      |     =>   |
      K          M'
      |          |
      J          J
      ```

      With `--insert-before/-B`, the selected revisions will be inserted before
      the targets. This is achieved by rebasing the selected revisions onto the
      target revisions' parents, and then rebasing the target revisions and their
      descendants onto the rebased revisions.

      For example, `jj rebase -r K -B L` will rewrite history like this:
      ```text
      N           N'
      |           |
      | M         | M'
      |/          |/
      L     =>    L'
      |           |
      | K         K'
      |/          |
      J           J
      ```

      The `-A` and `-B` arguments can also be combined, which can be useful around
      merges. For example, you can use `jj rebase -r K -A J -B M` to create a new
      merge (but `jj rebase -r M -o L -o K` might be simpler in this particular
      case):
      ```text
      M           M'
      |           |\
      L           L |
      |     =>    | |
      | K         | K'
      |/          |/
      J           J
      ```

      To insert a commit inside an existing merge with `jj rebase -r O -A K -B M`:
      ```text
      O           N'
      |           |\
      N           | M'
      |\          | |\
      | M         | O'|
      | |    =>   |/ /
      | L         | L
      | |         | |
      K |         K |
      |/          |/
      J           J
      ```

      Restore paths from another revision

      That means that the paths get the same content in the destination (`--into`) as they had in the source (`--from`). This is typically used for undoing changes to some paths in the working copy (`jj restore <paths>`).

      If only one of `--from` or `--into` is specified, the other one defaults to the working copy.

      When neither `--from` nor `--into` is specified, the command restores into the working copy from its parent(s). `jj restore` without arguments is similar to `jj abandon`, except that it leaves an empty revision with its description and other metadata preserved.

      See `jj diffedit` if you'd like to restore portions of files rather than entire files.

        You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

        Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

        When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

This would make a different revision empty, and the user might not even realize something went wrong.

      With the `--from` and/or `--into` options, moves changes from/to the given revisions. If either is left out, it defaults to the working-copy commit. For example, `jj squash --into @--` moves changes from the working-copy commit to the grandparent.

      If, after moving changes out, the source revision is empty compared to its parent(s), and `--keep-emptied` is not set, it will be abandoned. Without `--interactive` or paths, the source revision will always be empty.

      If the source was abandoned and both the source and destination had a non-empty description, you will be asked for the combined description. If either was empty, then the other one will be used.

      If a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

      EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

      An alternative squashing UI is available via the `-o`, `-A`, and `-B` options. Using any of these options creates a new commit. They can be used together with one or more `--from` options (if no `--from` is specified, `--from @` is assumed).

        Operation to load the repo at

        Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

        You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

        Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

        When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

        It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

      ignore-working-copy: |-
        Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it

If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

        Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.

        Operation to load the repo at

        Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

        You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

        Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

        When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

        It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

        Allow rewriting immutable commits

        By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits. This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.

        This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or the `immutable` template keyword.
      ignore-working-copy: |-
        Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it

        By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

        Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.

        This is useful for arbitrary aliases.

        !! WARNING !!

        The following technique just provides a convenient syntax for running
        arbitrary code on your system. Using it irresponsibly may cause damage
        ranging from breaking the behavior of `jj undo` to wiping your file system.
        Exercise the same amount of caution while writing these aliases as you would
        when typing commands into the terminal!

        This feature may be removed or replaced by an embedded scripting language in
        the future.

        Let's assume you have a script called "my-jj-script" in you $PATH and you
        would like to execute it as "jj my-script". You would add the following line
        to your configuration file to achieve that:

        ```toml
        [aliases]
        my-script = ["util", "exec", "--", "my-jj-script"]
        #                            ^^^^
        # This makes sure that flags are passed to your script instead of parsed by jj.
        ```

        If you don't want to manage your script as a separate file, you can even
        inline it into your config file:

        ```toml
        [aliases]
        my-inline-script = ["util", "exec", "--", "bash", "-c", """
        set -euo pipefail
        echo "Look Ma, everything in one file!"
        echo "args: $@"
        """, ""]
        #    ^^
        # This last empty string will become "$0" in bash, so your actual arguments
        # are all included in "$@" and start at "$1" as expected.
        ```

        > Note: Shebangs (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env`) aren't necessary since you're
        > already explicitly passing your script into the right shell.

The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

      Commands for working with workspaces

      Workspaces let you add additional working copies attached to the same repo. A common use case is so you can run a slow build or test in one workspace while you're continuing to write code in another workspace.

      Each workspace has its own working-copy commit. When you have more than one workspace attached to a repo, they are indicated by `<workspace name>@` in `jj log`.

      Each workspace also has own sparse patterns.

          Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.
        quiet: |-
          Silence non-primary command output

          For example, `jj file list` will still list files, but it won't tell you if the working copy was snapshotted or if descendants were rebased.

          Warnings and errors will still be printed.

          Operation to load the repo at

          Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

          You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

          Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

          When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

          It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.

          Allow rewriting immutable commits

          By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits. This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.

          This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or the `immutable` template keyword.

          Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it

          By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.
